<h2>THE CAMP FIRE GIRLS&rsquo;
<br /><span class="small">LARKS AND PRANKS</span></h2>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">THE HOUSE OF THE OPEN DOOR</span></h2>
<p>It was the crisp chill of an early October evening;
in the still air the dead leaves came rustling down
with a soft sound like whispers, while the crickets
chirped a cheery welcome from the waiting earth.
Over the treetops a big yellow hunter&rsquo;s moon was
rising; its comical face grinning good-naturedly. It
looked down on the dark outlines of a large barn
standing in the shadow of a tall tree and the grin
widened perceptibly. Evidently something was happening
on earth.</p>
<p>A dark form stole softly up the long drive leading
to the barn and paused before the door. Through
the silence there rose the whistling wail of the whippoorwill,
repeated three times, and ending abruptly
in the squall of a catbird. From within the blackness
of the barn came an echo of the whippoorwill&rsquo;s
call, followed by a much more cheerful note&mdash;the
carol of the bluebird. Then a clear voice called from
inside, &ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A friend,&rdquo; came the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand and give the countersign,&rdquo; commanded the
voice inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other Council Fires were here before,&rdquo; responded
the newcomer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Advance and give the Inner Password,&rdquo; said the
invisible sentinel.</p>
<p>The figure passed through the dark entrance and
came to a halt just inside, crying, &ldquo;Kolah Olowan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mount!&rdquo; commanded the voice above, and the
stranger lost no time in obeying the invitation.
Scrambling up the ladder fastened to the wall which
did duty as a staircase, she thrust aside the curtain
at the top and stepped out into the lighted upper
chamber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>Anyone seeing that dark and deserted looking
building from the outside would never guess how
bright and cheerful was that upper room within. A
wood fire roared in a cobblestone fireplace, its gleam
lighting up walls hung with leather skins and gay
Indian blankets and festooned with sprays of bittersweet.
Several more Indian blankets were spread
out on the floor in lieu of rugs, while from the rafters
were suspended woven baskets and pieces of pottery.
Ranged around the sides of the chamber,
where the sloping roof met the floor, were four beds,
all different, and only one indicating that the dwellers
in that secret lodge were civilized persons. The
first was a neat cot bed with blankets tucked in
smoothly all around, and a dust cover folded up at
the foot; the second was an &ldquo;Indian bed&rdquo; made of
pine branches, dried ferns and sweet grasses, piled
several feet high and ingeniously confined by woven
reeds and pliant twigs. The scent of the sweet
grasses, mingled with the aromatic odor of the pine,
filled the room with a dreamy fragrance that seemed
like a charm to lure down the Sleep Manitou. The
third was a pile of bearskins and the fourth was another
kind of Indian bed, made of smooth round willow
rods tied together with ropes and laid across two
poles fastened into the wall.</p>
<p>No windows were visible, as these had been covered
with skins. Except for the camp bed, the wide
hearthstone and one other detail it might have been
the lodge of some Indian Chief of olden time. That
other detail was a green felt pennant stretched across
the chimney above the stone shelf of the fireplace,
bearing in clean-cut English letters the word WINNEBAGO.
Most of our readers have probably
guessed the truth before this&mdash;the Indian lodge we
have been describing is the meeting place of the Winnebago
Camp Fire Girls and the solitary visitor who
uttered the plaintive cry of the whippoorwill with its
grotesque ending in a cat call is none other than our
old friend, Sahwah the Sunfish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>&ldquo;O Nyoda, such larks!&rdquo; cried Sahwah, skipping
across the room and bestowing a hasty embrace on
the sentinel guarding the fire, whom the reader has
doubtless suspected of being Miss Kent, the Guardian
of the Winnebago group.</p>
<p>Nyoda laughingly shook herself free and
smoothed out the Ceremonial dress she held in her
hand, which had become sadly crumpled during the
process of Sahwah&rsquo;s bear hug. &ldquo;What mischief are
you into this time?&rdquo; she asked fondly, smiling down
into Sahwah&rsquo;s dancing eyes.</p>
<p>Sahwah went into a gale of giggles before she
could explain. &ldquo;You know Gladys was going to
drive all of us girls down in the Glow-worm to-night,&rdquo;
she said, controlling her laughter with an effort,
&ldquo;and she telephoned Hinpoha while I was there
to dinner that she was over at Mrs. Varden&rsquo;s, the
dressmaker&rsquo;s, having a fit, and the Glow-worm was
standing out in front of the house, so we should
gather up the other girls and get into the car and
wait for her to come out, to save her the time of
going around after the girls, for her fit threatened
to be a lengthy one. So Hinpoha started out after
Medmangi and Nakwisi and I went back home after
these apples, which I&rsquo;d forgotten to take along to
Hinpoha&rsquo;s. When I got to the corner of the street
along came Gladys in the Glow-worm and said she
had an errand to do for her mother in a hurry and
we had better come straight out here without her
and she would come later. I hurried over to Mrs.
Varden&rsquo;s house to tell the girls, but when I got
nearly there I saw a black car standing out in front
and Hinpoha and Nakwisi and Medmangi sitting in
it as cool as cucumbers, thinking they were in the
Glow-worm. I recognized the car as belonging to
that horribly bashful son of Mrs. Varden&rsquo;s, and I
couldn&rsquo;t resist the temptation to let the girls sit in it
until he came out. So I stole back up the street,
keeping in the shadow of the trees so the girls
wouldn&rsquo;t see me, and came out here. Oh, won&rsquo;t
there be a situation though, when &lsquo;Dolly&rsquo; Varden
comes out and finds his nice bachelor car full of
bold, bad girls!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>The picture was too much for Sahwah, and she
rolled on the bed shrieking with laughter, in which
Nyoda joined heartily. &ldquo;I wonder how long it will
be before they come,&rdquo; said Sahwah, rising from the
bed and wiping her eyes. &ldquo;What shall we do to
pass away the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were you,&rdquo; advised Nyoda, &ldquo;I would spend
it searching a nice safe retreat to which you can fly
when they come and find out you didn&rsquo;t tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had she spoken the words when there
floated up from below the familiar cry of the whippoorwill,
followed successively by the long, eerie
laugh of the loon, the blithe whistle of the quail and
the song of the robin. &ldquo;There they are!&rdquo; exclaimed
Sahwah in mock terror. &ldquo;Where shall I hide?
Oh, I have it, I&rsquo;ll get inside of that pile of bearskins
and listen while they tell their tale of woe to you
and then I&rsquo;ll hop out and laugh at them.&rdquo; Quick as
a flash she jumped into the bearskin bed and pulled
the skins over her so that she was entirely concealed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>With a great deal of chattering and giggling the
three arrivals were mounting the ladder. &ldquo;Keep on
going, Hinpoha!&rdquo; exclaimed Nakwisi, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re stepping
on my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep on going yourself,&rdquo; retorted Hinpoha,
&ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t a pie in your hand.&rdquo; Just at that moment
her foot slipped and she clutched wildly at the
ladder for support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes the pie!&rdquo; shrieked someone, as it described
a circle in the air and landed with a thud.
Hinpoha wrung her hands in grief, for her mouth
was already watering for that crisp pastry.</p>
<p>Medmangi walked over to view the remains. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t hurt a mite,&rdquo; she said calmly, picking it up and
dusting it off. &ldquo;Fortunately it landed right side up
in the tin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;O Nyoda,&rdquo; cried Hinpoha, beaming once more
now that the feast of pie was assured, &ldquo;we had the
most fun getting here! Gladys told us the Glow-worm
was standing out in front of the Varden&rsquo;s
house and we should get in and wait for her, and
we saw a car and got in. Pretty soon out came
young Mr. Varden, got into the front seat without
looking to the right or left and drove off. We
thought of course he was driving Gladys&rsquo; car away
and we all three shrieked at him at once. He pretty
nearly dropped dead when he heard us, and stopped
the car so suddenly we all flew out of the seat. But
he was perfectly grand about it when we found out
our mistake. He told us Gladys had gone home fifteen
minutes before, but he would be perfectly delighted
to drive us where we wanted to go. And so
he brought us out,&rdquo; she finished with a dramatic
flourish, and sat down heavily on top of the bearskin
bed where Sahwah lay hidden. Immediately
there was an upheaval and a grotesque animal sprang
from the bed, an animal which had the skin of a
bear and two red stockinged legs which capered
wildly about while their owner shrieked piercingly,
&ldquo;She sat on my breathing apparatus and I won&rsquo;t be
able to talk for a week!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> talking, you goose,&rdquo; said Hinpoha,
calmly seating herself again after poking the bed
to see if it were further inhabited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You missed it, Sahwah, by going home,&rdquo; she
continued. &ldquo;Too bad you weren&rsquo;t along to share
the fun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>Sahwah&rsquo;s expression was funny to behold when
she learned how the joke had turned out, for it was
not on the girls after all, but on herself, for she had
walked all the way to the lodge by herself. She
looked rather silly as she caught Nyoda&rsquo;s eye, but
while Nyoda twinkled mischievously at her Sahwah
knew that she would never give her away. But of
course when Gladys arrived a few minutes later and
heard the story, Sahwah&rsquo;s part in it came out and she
had to stand the gibes of the others because her
joke had turned round on herself, until Nyoda called
the beginning of the Ceremonial and peace was restored.</p>
<p>One name has been dropped from the Count Book
of the Winnebagos since last we heard the roll called,
and to another there is no reply, although it is always
called. Early in the fall Chapa the Chipmunk
moved to a distant city, and so for the first time the
close circle of the Winnebagos was broken. Then
shortly afterward Migwan went away to college and
her departure caused a fresh bereavement. Though
Migwan had been of such a very quiet nature, her
influence had been widely felt, and the girls missed
her more and more as the days went on. Hinpoha,
especially, was almost inconsolable, for she and Migwan
had always stood a little closer together than
the rest of the girls. This was the first Ceremonial
Meeting without the two and it seemed very strange
indeed to omit Chapa&rsquo;s name from the roll, and when
Migwan&rsquo;s name was called and was followed by silence,
Hinpoha sniffed audibly and wiped her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister, this is a very solemn occasion,&rdquo; said Sahwah
the irrepressible, in such a forced tone of sorrow
that it was impossible not to laugh at her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Nyoda. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do for us
to pull long faces. We have vowed to &lsquo;be happy&rsquo;
you know. Think how much worse off Chapa is
alone in a strange city. Come, be cheerful and tell
what kind deeds you have seen done today. You
begin, Sahwah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sahwah took hold of her toes with her hands and
tilted back and forth on the floor as she spoke.
&ldquo;Sally Jones did me a great service yesterday in
composition class. You know Sally Jones&mdash;the one
they call the Blunderbuss. Well, you know what a
pig I am when it comes to writing composition. I
never wrote one yet that I didn&rsquo;t get a blot on. Last
week when I handed mine in Miss Snively said that
if there was a blot on my paper this week she would
mark me zero for the month. So yesterday when
we had to write one in class I took the utmost care
and got it all done spotlessly and was just signing
my name when Anna Green behind me tried to pick
a thread off my collar and laid her fishy cold hand
against my neck. I jumped and wriggled and the
result was a beautiful blot on my composition.
There wasn&rsquo;t time to copy it over because it was almost
the end of the hour, so I resigned myself to a
nice fat cipher on my report card this month. Then
Miss Snively sent Sally around to collect the papers
and when she came to my desk she leaned across it
in such an awkward way that she upset my inkwell
all over my composition and my one small blot was
completely hidden by the deluge. Miss Snively
graciously requested me to do it over in rest hour,
which I did, and handed it in in perfect shape. Upsetting
that inkwell was the kindest thing anybody
ever did for me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>There was a moment of laughter at Sahwah&rsquo;s tale
of kindness and then quiet fell on the group again.
&ldquo;Tell us a story, Nyoda,&rdquo; begged Hinpoha, breaking
the silence, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re getting low in our minds
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; begged the others.</p>
<p>Nyoda sat silent a moment staring thoughtfully
into the fire. Her hands were clasped around her
knees and the light shone on the diamond ring which
now encircled the fourth finger of her left hand&mdash;the
only thing which made the girls realize that their
amazing adventures of the first week in September
had been a reality and not a dream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In a village in eastern Hungary,&rdquo; began Nyoda,
&ldquo;there lived a girl about your age. Her father was
a very wealthy man, and lived on a great estate.
Veronica&mdash;that was the girl&rsquo;s name&mdash;was the only
child, and had everything that her heart desired.
The thing she loved to do the best was ride horse-back
and she had a beautiful horse for her very own.
She showed great talent on the violin and had the
best masters. Veronica grew to be seventeen as
happy as a girl could be, with an indulgent father
and a beautiful, sweet mother. Then a dreadful
thing happened. War was declared in the country
and the village where they lived was taken by the
enemy. Her father was killed, their home was
burned and her mother died. Veronica, with the
rest of the people in the village, ran away toward
the mountains when the village burned. But Veronica
became separated from her friends and fell,
and could not get up again, for her leg was broken.
She lay there a long time, and gave herself up for
lost, when she heard a whinny beside her and there
was her pet horse, who had been following her all
the way. She managed to swing herself up on his
back and he galloped away to the safety of the
mountains. They found their way across the border
into another country where some kind people
took care of the orphan girl. The faithful horse
fell after he had brought her to safety and hurt
himself so badly that he had to be shot. The people
who took care of Veronica sent her across the ocean
to her aunt and uncle. So, sad and lonesome, she
came to this country to be an American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Nyoda paused for breath, and Hinpoha
burst out quickly, &ldquo;Oh, how I wish this had happened
in our time and that poor lonely girl had
come to this city and we had met her and made her
happy. Wouldn&rsquo;t we be kind to her, though, if we
had a chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nyoda proceeded quietly. &ldquo;All this <i>has</i> happened
in your time, and this lonesome girl <i>has</i> come to our
city, and you are going to have a chance to be kind
to her often.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nyoda!&rdquo; shrieked all the girls at once. &ldquo;You
mean she lives in our city, and you actually know
her?&rdquo; &ldquo;Where does she live?&rdquo; &ldquo;When will we see
her?&rdquo; &ldquo;What is her whole name?&rdquo; &ldquo;How old did
you say she was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have mercy!&rdquo; exclaimed Nyoda, putting her
hands over her ears. &ldquo;I can only answer ten questions
at once. Veronica&rsquo;s uncle is Mr. Lehar, the
conductor of the Temple Theatre orchestra. I live
next door to them, you know, and am well acquainted
with Mrs. Lehar. She told me about Veronica
some time ago and last week she went to New York
to get her. I immediately asked her to allow her niece
to join the Winnebago group, if you girls were willing
to take her, that she might not be lonely here.
Will you take her in, girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly will!&rdquo; cried Gladys and Hinpoha
in a breath, and Sahwah sprang to her feet exclaiming
vehemently, &ldquo;Well, I guess so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When is she coming?&rdquo; they wanted to know
next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring her to the next meeting,&rdquo; promised
Nyoda, &ldquo;and I want you girls to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>What it was she wanted them to do they never
found out, for just at that minute there was a terrific
thump on the floor below followed by the hurried
clatter of heavy footsteps, then the scraping of
feet on the ladder, a great waving and billowing of
the curtain at the top and then it was wrenched aside,
and into the Council Chamber there burst the fattest
boy they had ever seen. His great cheeks hung
down over his collar; his eyes were nearly buried.
His face was purple from violent exertion and he
sat limply against the bearskin bed, panting heavily.
The girls stared open-mouthed at the intruder. Before
they had recovered sufficiently from their astonishment
to utter a single word, the barn below
was filled with the noise of many footsteps and the
shouting of many voices, and the next minute the
sacred Council Chamber of the Winnebagos was
filled to overflowing with boys.</p>
<p>At the sight of the lighted chamber and the girls
in Indian costumes the intruders stopped and stared
in speechless surprise. Then with one accord seven
hats were snatched from as many heads and seven
voices exclaimed as one, &ldquo;Beg pardon, we didn&rsquo;t
know anyone was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was so funny to hear them all saying the same
thing at once that the Winnebagos could not help
laughing aloud. The confusion of the boys was
so painful that the girls actually felt sorry for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are only <i>seven</i> of you,&rdquo; said Sahwah, as
usual breaking the silence first. &ldquo;I thought at first
there were <i>hundreds</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Here one of the boys found his voice to speak.
He was a tall boy with curly brown hair and nice
eyes, and his face was suffused with blushes of embarrassment.
&ldquo;Sorry to disturb you girls,&rdquo; he said
soberly, but with a twinkle in his eye. &ldquo;We were
chasing <i>him</i>&rdquo;&mdash;and he pointed to the fat boy still
puffing away for dear life on the floor&mdash;&ldquo;and we
couldn&rsquo;t see any light from the outside and we didn&rsquo;t
know anybody was up here and when Slim ran in we
just followed him. We&rsquo;ll go right away again, and
let you go on with your meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nyoda looked from one face to the other&mdash;nice
refined boys they were, she decided, and it would do
no hurt to show them courtesy. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be in
such a great hurry to go,&rdquo; she said cordially. &ldquo;You
may at least stay until you have recovered your
breath.&rdquo; And she looked quizzically at the fat boy
leaning against the bearskins who did not seem ever
to be going to breathe again.</p>
<p>He tried to show his appreciation of her hospitality
by getting up and making a bow, which threw
him into such an advanced stage of breathlessness
that he sank down again directly and had to be
fanned. This caused another general laugh and the
boys and girls rubbed elbows so closely trying to revive
him that all feeling of embarrassment vanished
and it suddenly seemed as if they were old friends,
in spite of the fact that none of them knew the others&rsquo;
names. Nyoda came to herself with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse us, boys,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for not introducing
ourselves. I am Miss Kent, Guardian of the Winnebago
Camp Fire Girls, and these are the Winnebagos,&rdquo;
and she named them in order. &ldquo;We were
having a rather doleful time when you arrived. You
broke up the spell of gloom and we are deeply grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>The tall boy spoke again, this time smiling
broadly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the ones who ought to apologize
for not introducing ourselves,&rdquo; he said in a pleasant
voice, &ldquo;since we have caused so much disturbance.
We&rsquo;re the Sandwich Club,&rdquo; he continued, including
all the boys in a sweeping gesture of his hand. &ldquo;We
go to Carnegie Mechanic. That&rsquo;s Slim over there,&rdquo;
he said, pointing to the fat one, while all the girls
laughed. &ldquo;His real name&rsquo;s Lewis Carlton, but it&rsquo;s
so long since anyone has called him that that he&rsquo;s
forgotten what it is himself. We chase him all over
the country to reduce him, but sometimes he gives
us the slip and hides and it takes us so long to find
him that in the meantime he gains more than he lost
while we were chasing him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls fairly shouted at this and Slim doubled
up a cushion-like fist and declared in a choking voice
that if the fellows didn&rsquo;t leave him in peace he&rsquo;d sit
down on them some day and that would be the end
of them. The tall boy who was doing the introducing
smiled sweetly at Slim and went on with the introductions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one,&rdquo; he said, indicating an extremely thin,
hungry-looking, gaunt-featured lad with sombre
brown eyes and a grave mouth, &ldquo;is Bill Pitt. &lsquo;Bottomless
Pitt,&rsquo; we call him, because it&rsquo;s impossible to
fill him up. You girls have heard of the Sheep Eaters?&rdquo;
he asked suddenly, looking from one to the
other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; chorused the Winnebagos, not wishing to
appear ignorant, but not sure whether the Sheep
Eaters were beasts of prey or persons overfond of
mutton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued the spokesman, pointing to the
&ldquo;Bottomless Pitt,&rdquo; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a Pie Eater, he is. He eats
&rsquo;em whole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hinpoha&rsquo;s glance strayed nervously to the shelf
where the apple pie stood awaiting the end of the
Ceremonial Meeting. The tall boy&rsquo;s eyes followed
here and his teeth showed in a wide smile, as he
seemed to read her thoughts. Hinpoha blushed fiery
red and dropped her eyes. But he looked away
again immediately and did not increase her embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, drawing forward a spidery little
fellow with red hair and freckles all over his face,
&ldquo;is Munson K. McKee, called for short, Monkey,
and those,&rdquo; indicating the other three, &ldquo;are Dan Porter,
Peter Jenkins and Harry Raymond. We seven
boys have always gone together, so we decided to
form a club, and we all like sandwiches so well that
we named ourselves the Sandwich Club. There,
now you know all about us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t told us <i>your</i> name,&rdquo; said the
Winnebagos, who were beginning to like the spokesman
very much, and were anxiously waiting to hear
him introduce himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I haven&rsquo;t.
My name,&rdquo; he said solemnly, but with that suggestion
of a twinkle in his eye again, &ldquo;is Cicero St.
John&mdash;and the fellows <i>don&rsquo;t</i> call me Cissy for
short.&rdquo; Here the corners of his mouth twitched as
at some humorous memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet they don&rsquo;t call him Cissy!&rdquo; put in the
Bottomless Pitt.</p>
<p>Hinpoha&rsquo;s eyes met Gladys&rsquo; in comical dismay.
How could anyone in their right senses name a boy&mdash;an
American boy&mdash;Cicero! The St. John part
sounded very fine, but that awful Cicero!</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you keep them from calling you&mdash;Cissy?&rdquo;
ventured Sahwah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He licked the tar out of them!&rdquo; spoke up the
Monkey. &ldquo;And he dumped one fellow overboard
out in the lake when he tried it. Everybody calls
him &lsquo;Cap&rsquo; now, because he&rsquo;s captain of the football
team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; murmured the Winnebagos, looking at
Cicero St. John with fresh interest and great respect,
for all the world loves a football player.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>And then the boys wanted to know all about the
Winnebagos, and thought their symbolic names and
&ldquo;queer duds&rdquo; even funnier than the girls had considered
theirs. But they all voiced their unqualified
approval of the Camp Fire Girls when they heard
that the Ceremonial Meeting was to be topped off
with a feast of apple pie, doughnuts and cider, and
did not need to be asked more than once to stay,
and share the feast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this is a peach of a meeting place,&rdquo; said the
Captain with his mouth full. &ldquo;How did you happen
to get it, and whoever thought of putting a
fireplace upstairs in a barn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got it as the result of a sort of wager,&rdquo; explained
Hinpoha. &ldquo;Gladys&rsquo; father promised that if
we could go on an automobile trip all by ourselves
without once telegraphing to him for aid he would
build us a Lodge to hold our meetings in, and we
did and so he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So <i>they</i> did, and <i>he</i> did, and the bears did,&rsquo;&rdquo;
quoted Nyoda teasingly.</p>
<p>Hinpoha laughed and went on. &ldquo;He owned this
empty barn out here in the field and he turned it
over to us. But we just had to have a fireplace or
it wouldn&rsquo;t have been a regular Camp Fire Lodge,
so he built this splendid chimney. We have named
the Lodge &lsquo;The House of the Open Door,&rsquo; or the
&lsquo;Open Door Lodge,&rsquo; to signify hospitality. Mr.
Evans wanted to build a fine stairway, too, but we
wouldn&rsquo;t have it. It&rsquo;s lots more fun to climb the
ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you use the ground floor?&rdquo; asked
Slim, who could never see the sense of exerting
one&rsquo;s self needlessly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s much cosier up here,&rdquo; replied Hinpoha.
&ldquo;We have these adorable peaks and gables to hang
things on. Besides, we wanted to leave the big
floor downstairs clear for dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dancing? Do you dance?&rdquo; cried the boys, pricking
up their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We surely do,&rdquo; replied the girls. &ldquo;Would you
like to come down and try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down the ladder they went in a hurry, Slim being
pushed from above and pulled from below, and landing
on the floor in his usual breathless state. A few
lanterns were hung around the walls and the big
door opened wide to let in the bright rays of the
full moon and the place was nearly as light as day.
Nyoda played her banjo and the twelve pairs of feet
shuffled merrily to the lively strains. As there were
only five girls, Slim and Peter Jenkins were left
without partners and consoled themselves by dancing
together. Peter came just to Slim&rsquo;s shoulder
and weighed ninety-five pounds against Slim&rsquo;s two
hundred and thirty, and the result was so ludicrous
that the rest could hardly dance for laughing. It
was like a monkey dancing with an elephant. Slim
took mincing little steps and looked down at his
partner with a simpering, languishing expression,
while Peter strained heroically to encircle his fair
one&rsquo;s waist with his arm. Rocking back and forth
in exaggerated rhythm, Slim tripped over a board
and fell with a great crash, pinning his gallant partner
under him. The rest flew to the rescue and
propped Peter up against the wall, fanning him vigorously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll recover,&rdquo; pronounced the Captain, after a
thorough going over of his bones, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;ll never
be the same again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All is over between us,&rdquo; said Slim, wringing his
hands in mock despair. &ldquo;Miss Kent, won&rsquo;t <i>you</i>
dance with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time we were going home,&rdquo; said Nyoda
calmly. &ldquo;Come, girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go home!&rdquo; echoed the Captain. &ldquo;I thought you
lived here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how about all the beds upstairs?&rdquo; asked the
Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; explained Nyoda, &ldquo;we all constructed different
kinds of beds to win honors, and left
them there in case we might want to stay some
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty fine clubhouse, I&rsquo;ll say,&rdquo; remarked
the Bottomless Pitt in a tone of envy. &ldquo;I wish we
Sandwiches had one like it. We have no place to
call our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hinpoha&rsquo;s thoughts leaped to the Fire Song, the
words of which hung beside the fireplace up above:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>Whose house is bare and dark and cold,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Whose house is cold,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>This is his own.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>She spoke impulsively. &ldquo;Oh, Nyoda, couldn&rsquo;t we
let them use the ground floor to hold their meeting
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cheer burst from the seven boys&rsquo; lips. &ldquo;Hooray!
May we, Miss Kent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nyoda was silent and looked at the boys with a
troubled expression, and her glance as it rested on
Hinpoha held a reproof. There was an awkward
silence. Then the Captain spoke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand what you mean, Miss Kent,&rdquo; he
said simply and straightforwardly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
know anything about us and of course you wouldn&rsquo;t
want to share your club house with us on such short
acquaintance. We wouldn&rsquo;t think much of you if
you did. It was all right of course for you to ask
us to stay and dance with the girls this one evening
when you were here with us, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean
that you&rsquo;re willing to adopt us. But we like you
girls first rate, and want to know you better if you
will let us. You can go to any of the teachers at
Carnegie Mechanic and find out all you want to
know about us. Pitt&rsquo;s father is Math teacher there
and my father is Dr. Cicero St. John. It was simply
great of you to offer to let us come here and
hold our meetings, and if you&rsquo;ll still keep the offer
open after you have investigated us to your satisfaction
we&rsquo;ll be mighty grateful and will promise
not to bother you upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s face was so open and manly that it was
impossible not to believe in him then and there.
Nyoda smiled into his earnest face. &ldquo;All right,
Captain,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll agree to put you on probation,
and if you stand the test we&rsquo;ll consider the
matter of sharing the Open Door Lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain smiled back at her and held out his
hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a peach and I like you,&rdquo; he said
emphatically, and the two were sworn friends from
that moment on.</p>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">VERONICA</span></h2>
<p>At four o&rsquo;clock one afternoon some few days
later Hinpoha and Sahwah, breathless from hurrying,
ran up the steps of the house where Nyoda
lived and rang the bell. The other Winnebagos
were already assembled when they entered, and
Nyoda was not there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Nyoda?&rdquo; demanded Sahwah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh, she&rsquo;s gone over to get&mdash;<i>her</i>,&rdquo; answered
Gladys, smoothing out the folds of her pretty new
pleated dress with one hand and tucking in a stray
lock with the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say &lsquo;sh&rsquo; for?&rdquo; demanded Sahwah
curiously. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one sleeping, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I said it,&rdquo; answered Gladys,
rumpling up the hair she had just tidied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so
excited about meeting Veronica that I don&rsquo;t know
what I&rsquo;m doing. I just can&rsquo;t sit still.&rdquo; And she
jumped up from her chair and began to pace nervously
up and down the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it remind you of the time we stood on
the dock at Loon Lake and waited for Gladys to
make her first appearance?&rdquo; said Hinpoha to Sahwah.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember how we wondered what
she would be like and you and Migwah nearly fought
over whose affinity she was going to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you really, girls?&rdquo; said Gladys, pausing in
her walk. &ldquo;And was I as nice as you hoped I&rsquo;d
be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Footsteps on the porch saved Hinpoha from having
to reply and Gladys hurried to her chair and
seated herself properly. A moment later Nyoda
entered the room with a young girl beside her whom
she led into the center of the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; she said, with one hand on the stranger&rsquo;s
shoulder, &ldquo;this is our new member, Veronica Lehar.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>All eyes centered on the newcomer. She was a
small, slender girl with short curly black hair, olive
complexion, bright red lips and a straight, finely
modeled nose. She wore a dark red velvet dress
which suited her complexion wonderfully, and fell
in soft folds about her lithe form. She was as
straight as an arrow and as graceful as a deer.
From the crown of her finely poised head to her
little fur-topped boots she was an aristocrat. The
simple Winnebagos were abashed before her. Never
had they met such a high-born little lady. There
was an air about her which they could never acquire
if they lived a hundred years. They felt like
peasants in the presence of a queen. But they forgot
her aristocratic air when they looked into her
eyes. Large and dark and velvety as a pansy, but
so sad it almost broke your heart to look into them.
All the sympathy which the girls had worked up
for her since hearing her story came back in a rush
and they surrounded her with cordial greetings and
expressions of welcome. Veronica held her violin,
which she had brought over with her, under one
arm while she shook hands politely with all the girls.
She answered all their pretty speeches in a friendly
manner, but she never once smiled, and her eyes had
a look as if her thoughts were not there in the room
at all, but back in the far country across the ocean.
Although she had an accent she spoke a beautiful
English, in fact, she used far better language than
the majority of American schoolgirls, and more
than once the girls felt embarrassed when they had
forgotten themselves so far as to utter a slang
phrase.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>Conversation soon languished, for Veronica did
not seem inclined to talk, so Nyoda started the girls
singing camp songs to amuse her, and led the talk
around to the Winnebagos&rsquo; doings which she was
now to take part in. Of course the new lodge was
the main topic of conversation with the Winnebagos
and they waxed so enthusiastic over its splendors
that Veronica exclaimed with some show of warmth,
&ldquo;Oh, I must see it soon!&rdquo; Then she added, &ldquo;Tell
me what I must do to become a Camp Fire Girl
like yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have a symbolic name,&rdquo; answered
Gladys eagerly, anxious to be the one to explain
things to Veronica, &ldquo;and a Ceremonial dress, and
learn the songs, and know the Camp Fire Girls&rsquo; Desire,
and the Winnebago passwords and oh, lots of
delightful things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they, the Winnebago passwords, and
what are they for?&rdquo; asked Veronica.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Gladys, &ldquo;you know what a
password is, don&rsquo;t you? Well, we have passwords
to admit us into the Lodge on Ceremonial night.
But before I tell you about the passwords I must
tell you about the signal calls, for they come first
in order. You see, the general signal of the Winnebagos
is the call of the whippoorwill, like this&rdquo;&mdash;and
she illustrated her words with a clear call. &ldquo;You
repeat that three times and at the end of it you
must give your own individual bird call. We all
have different ones. Mine is the robin, like this.
Nyoda&rsquo;s is the bluebird; Hinpoha&rsquo;s the loon; Medmangi&rsquo;s
is the owl; Nakwisi&rsquo;s the meadowlark and
Sahwah&rsquo;s the catbird.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever made you take such a hideous screech
for your call, Sahwah?&rdquo; interrupted Hinpoha.
&ldquo;There are lots of nicer bird calls than that of the
catbird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, I wanted the catbird,&rdquo; returned Sahwah.
&ldquo;It suits my individuality, as my dear friend,
Miss Snively, would say. I am the &lsquo;cat that walks
by himself and all places are alike to me!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be a catbird as much as you like,&rdquo; said Gladys
pacifically, &ldquo;as long as you don&rsquo;t eat us poor bird-birds.
But to go back to the passwords. You see,
Nyoda is Guardian of the Fire, and she always goes
up to the Lodge room first on Ceremonial night. If
any of us get there ahead of her we have to stay
out until she comes. Then we announce our coming
by giving the call of the whippoorwill and she
knows one of the Winnebagos is below; and she
knows which one it is by the individual bird call.
So she calls out &lsquo;Who goes there?&rsquo; and we answer
&lsquo;A friend.&rsquo; When she says, &lsquo;Stand and give the
countersign,&rsquo; we have to say, &lsquo;Other Council Fires
were here before.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean, &lsquo;Other Council Fires were
here before?&rsquo;&rdquo; asked Veronica.</p>
<p>The girls looked at one another. &ldquo;What does it
mean?&rdquo; asked Gladys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Sahwah.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Hinpoha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You insisted on our having it, Sahwah,&rdquo; said
Gladys. &ldquo;Why did you choose it if you didn&rsquo;t know
what it meant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; explained Sahwah lightly, &ldquo;I saw it written
over the door of one of the historical buildings
at the Exposition, and it sounded as if it might mean
something grand, so I chose it. You girls were all
delighted with it, so that&rsquo;s proof it&rsquo;s a good catch-word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a good countersign,&rdquo; said Nyoda, &ldquo;although
I confess I can&rsquo;t tell wherein the charm lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to proceed,&rdquo; said Gladys, &ldquo;after you have
given the countersign you will be asked to give the
Inner Pass Word, and then you must say &lsquo;Kolah
Olowan.&rsquo; That means &lsquo;Song Friend.&rsquo; You know
we pride ourselves on being a singing group, that is,
we have a great many songs that we sing together,
and I think our dearest friends are those we sing
with. So we Winnebagos call each other &lsquo;Song
Friends,&rsquo; or friends bound together by the power of
our familiar songs. That&rsquo;s why we chose bird notes
for our personal symbols. The birds are the original
Song Friends. What bird are you going to
choose for your own, Veronica?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Veronica&rsquo;s sad eyes stared thoughtfully into the
fire for a moment. Then they filled with a smouldering
light. &ldquo;I shall be the gull that flies over the
sea,&rdquo; she said in a low voice, &ldquo;because some day I
am going to fly over the sea to my dear home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We were all nearly ready to cry when she said
that,&rdquo; wrote Gladys to Migwan, &ldquo;only Nyoda popped
up then and asked Hinpoha and Sahwah to sing
&lsquo;The Owl and the Pussycat,&rsquo; and they climbed on
the sofa for the beautiful pea-green boat&mdash;you know
what a beautiful pea-green it is&mdash;and for a small
guitar Nyoda gave Sahwah a little pasteboard fiddle
that produced three notes when you turned a crank,
and the whole thing was so ridiculous that we
laughed until our sides ached.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the Owl and the Pussycat had sung themselves
over the back of the sofa and down on the
floor with a thump Nyoda made tea in her new
electric teapot and passed platefuls of thin sandwiches,
and Sahwah upset her cup into her lap demonstrating
how perfectly she could balance it on her
knee and had to stand before the fire to dry her
skirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brought your violin along; won&rsquo;t you play
for us?&rdquo; asked Nyoda of Veronica when the excitement
over Sahwah&rsquo;s mishap had subsided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>In graceful compliance with Nyoda&rsquo;s request, and
without waiting to be urged, Veronica took her
violin from its case, settled it under her chin with a
movement that was a caress, and drew the bow
across the strings. With the first note teacups and
sandwiches were forgotten and the girls sat in a
spellbound circle, while Sahwah stopped mopping
her skirt with her handkerchief and the wet spot
dried and scorched unheeded. Such a witching
melody as rose from the strings&mdash;now light as a
fairy dancing on a bubble, now hurrying like the
brook over its pebbles, now sighing like the wind
in a rose tree, now slow and stately like the curtseying
of a grande dame in the movements of a court
dance. When it came to an end the girls sat breathless,
too dazed to applaud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play some more!&rdquo; begged Gladys in a whisper.
It seemed like a desecration to talk.</p>
<p>Veronica played on, now fast, now slow, now sad
and now gay, and finally whirled into a wild gypsy
dance that set the blood tingling in her hearers&rsquo;
veins as the swift measures followed on each other&rsquo;s
heels, until they could see in their mind&rsquo;s eye the
leaping figures of the dancers in their bright costumes.
Faster, faster, flashed the bow on the magic
strings and Veronica&rsquo;s whole soul was in her eyes
as she played the familiar strains of her homeland.
Her lips parted in a flashing smile and one foot
tapped the carpet in time to the music.</p>
<p>Suddenly a string snapped with a discordant
crash. Veronica came to herself with a start. The
light left her eyes and she stood staring into the
fire with a sad, bitter expression.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">AN UNINVITED GUEST</span></h2>
<p>Rain fell in torrents on the roof of the hospitable
House of the Open Door, and the wind howled dismally
around its friendly gables. Inside the &ldquo;lofty
loft&rdquo; of the Winnebagos the fire shone brightly on
the hearth and the rafters rang with merriment.
Sahwah had a new hobby, and was riding it to death.
This was a Hawaiian guitar, known as a &ldquo;ukelele,&rdquo;
from which she was producing a series of hair-raising
noises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a cat in its last agony,&rdquo; remarked
Hinpoha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that just suits me,&rdquo; replied Sahwah, undisturbed,
drawing a long shivering wail from the
strings. &ldquo;I am the cat that walks by himself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all racket is alike to you,&rdquo; finished Hinpoha.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s getting supper tonight, Nyoda? I&rsquo;m
nearly starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I appointed Gladys and Veronica,&rdquo; answered
Nyoda. &ldquo;The combination of blonde and brunette
ought to produce something pretty good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladys promptly laid down the bit of leather in
which she was cutting a pattern and moved toward
the &ldquo;kitchen end&rdquo; of the Lodge. &ldquo;Come on, Veronica,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s make a carload of scones for
these hungry wolves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>Veronica looked up at her without moving. On
her face was an expression of surprise; almost
amazement. &ldquo;What, <i>I</i> cook?&rdquo; she asked scornfully.
&ldquo;That is for servants to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then it was the Winnebagos&rsquo; turn to look amazed.
Sahwah dropped her instrument on the floor with a
clatter, and the rest sat silent, not knowing what to
say to Veronica. Nyoda bridged over the embarrassing
situation as best she could. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be cook tonight,&rdquo;
she said quietly. As she moved about helping
Gladys she thought and thought how this new
problem must be met. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fault of her training,&rdquo;
she told herself, &ldquo;and she really isn&rsquo;t a snob at
heart. She&rsquo;ll be all right when she has been with
the girls awhile and watched them. It won&rsquo;t do to
insist on her doing the things she considers beneath
her. She must be made to want to do them first.
But we&rsquo;ll make a real Winnebago of her in time!&rdquo;
And her eyes strayed thoughtfully over to the corner
of the hearth where Veronica sat, a little apart
from the rest, her brooding eyes on the fire, her
sensitive lip twisting into involuntary shivers of disgust
when Sahwah produced a particularly ear-splitting
yowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear and attend and listen, everybody,&rdquo; said
Nyoda when the buttered scones had been reduced
to crumbs. &ldquo;I have been doing some important research
work lately and am now ready to present the
result of my investigations.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; asked Hinpoha
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two weeks ago tonight,&rdquo; continued Nyoda, &ldquo;our
meeting was broken up by a band of young braves
bearing the appetizing title of &lsquo;The Sandwich Club,&rsquo;
who implored us to let them come and play with us
in our Lodge and be lodgers&mdash;kindly overlook the
pun; it was quite unintentional&mdash;providing we
weighed them in the balance and found them not
wanting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any scale on which &lsquo;Slim&rsquo; would be
found wanting?&rdquo; giggled Sahwah,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have spent the last two weeks obtaining information,&rdquo;
resumed Nyoda, &ldquo;which I am happy to
report is of a highly satisfactory nature. So, all
things considered, and in spite of the informality of
the request, I humbly recommend that the aforesaid
braves be allowed to lodge in the bottom half
of our Lodge at any and all times they may so
desire. I might add that I have already obtained
the consent of our Bountiful Benefactor, Gladys&rsquo;
papa. All in favor of letting in the Sandwich Club
say &lsquo;Aye.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a perfect shout of &ldquo;Ayes,&rdquo; followed by
a ringing cheer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are they going to take possession?&rdquo; Sahwah
wanted to know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m to tell them tomorrow what your decision
was,&rdquo; replied Nyoda. &ldquo;It being Saturday, I suppose
they will be down in a body to fix up according to
their own ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will the interior of a Sandwich Club look
like, I wonder?&rdquo; said Gladys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark, what was that noise?&rdquo; asked Nyoda abruptly.
The girls listened intently. From the lower
floor of the barn there came a thumping noise, followed
by a subdued crash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s in the barn,&rdquo; said Hinpoha in a
frightened whisper.</p>
<p>The sound came again, thump, thump, and a noise
as of a box being shoved aside. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a burglar!&rdquo;
said Sahwah, and Nakwisi gave a frightened squeak
which Sahwah stifled with a sofa cushion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in here to steal,&rdquo; said Nyoda.
&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s a tramp.&rdquo; Again came the noise from
below. Leaving the curtain drawn over the opening,
Nyoda went to the top of the ladder and called
down, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; There was no answer but
another thump. &ldquo;We have a gun,&rdquo; said Nyoda
coolly, taking Sahwah&rsquo;s little rifle down from the
wall, &ldquo;and if you put one foot on the ladder I&rsquo;ll
shoot.&rdquo; Still no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down to investigate,&rdquo; said Nyoda.
&ldquo;This is growing uncanny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go down,&rdquo; begged the girls, clinging to
her, &ldquo;something dreadful will happen to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you go I&rsquo;m going with you,&rdquo; declared Sahwah
when Nyoda appeared determined to rush into the
jaws of danger. Nyoda threw aside the curtain and
flashed her bug light on the floor below. Nothing
was visible within the radius of the light, but over
in the far corner where the old horse stall was
something was moving and thumping about and a
sound like a groan came from the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s hurt,&rdquo; said Nyoda, hastening down
the ladder. &ldquo;Bring a lantern with you, Sahwah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they moved toward the corner while the
girls above crowded around the opening and watched
in breathless suspense. The light revealed a small
donkey lying on the floor of the stall. He was
kicking out with his hind feet against the partition
wall and it was this sound that had frightened the
girls above. At Sahwah&rsquo;s shout the others came
hurrying down to behold the find. The donkey made
no effort to rise and looked at the faces around him
with an imploring look in his eyes as if to say,
&ldquo;Help me, I&rsquo;m in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, old chap?&rdquo; asked Nyoda,
kneeling down beside him. The donkey answered
with a distressed bray that was more like a groan
and pawed the air with his front feet, which seemed
to be fastened together in some manner. Nyoda
turned the lantern around so the light fell directly
on him and then they saw what the matter was.
A length of barbed wire had become tangled around
his front legs, binding them together, and his frantic
efforts to get it off had resulted in its becoming
deeply imbedded in the flesh, lacerating it badly.
The girls shuddered when they saw it and drew
back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do, girls,&rdquo; said Nyoda firmly; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
got to get that wire off the poor animal&rsquo;s leg. Medmangi,
have you the nerve to do it? I&rsquo;m afraid I
can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His hind legs would have to be tied together
first, so he can&rsquo;t kick,&rdquo; said Medmangi. The girls
looked at each other and all drew back. All but
Veronica. She came forward quietly and took the
rope which the others were afraid to use and skilfully
slipped a noose over the tiny heels and fastened
them down to a ring in the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have done it before, when a horse was sick,&rdquo;
she explained in response to the girls&rsquo; expressions
of amazement at the neat performance. The girls&rsquo;
liking for her, which had suffered a sudden chill at
the cooking episode, warmed again, and they were
inclined to overlook that now that she had stepped
so neatly into the breach when they were helpless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>Then Medmangi, the Medicine Man Girl who was
going to be a doctor, and had no horror of surgery,
bent calmly to her task while the others held the
lantern for her. Quickly and skilfully she worked,
removing the cruel points as gently as possible. Then
she washed the wounds with an antiseptic solution
from the First Aid Cabinet upstairs and bound them
up with clean bandages. Then Veronica took the
rope from the donkey&rsquo;s hind legs and he struggled
to his feet, plainly delighted to find his front legs
in working order again in spite of the pain. He
looked at the girls with a dog-like devotion in his
intelligent eyes and when Medmangi patted him
soothingly he laid his head on her shoulder affectionately.
&ldquo;My first lover&mdash;a donkey!&rdquo; she said
laughingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little mule,&rdquo; said Hinpoha, stroking him
from the other side. &ldquo;He knew the right place to
come to all right. &lsquo;Whose house is bare and dark
and cold, whose house is cold, this is his own,&rsquo;&rdquo; she
quoted dramatically. &ldquo;We certainly have succeeded
in creating the right atmosphere of hospitality if
even a lonely donkey can feel it and come straight
to our &lsquo;Open Portals!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now that he has come,&rdquo; said Nyoda, rather
puzzled, &ldquo;the question is what to do with him. If
he goes wandering off again he&rsquo;ll have those bandages
off in no time&mdash;he probably will anyhow&mdash;and
his legs will get so sore he will have to be shot.
He undoubtedly belongs to somebody&mdash;very likely
some children&rsquo;s pet&mdash;and I think we had better keep
him right here in the barn until we find the owner.
The boys will have to postpone their taking possession
in favor of the other donkey if his presence
interferes with their activities.&rdquo; Here the &ldquo;other
donkey&rdquo; leaned against the wall in such a pathetic
attitude, as if his weight were too much for his sore
legs, that if they had had any intentions of turning
him out into the rain they would have speedily
relented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing this old stall is still here,&rdquo; said
Gladys. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any straw, but there is a box
of excelsior and we can spread that out and cover
it with a blanket and make him a soft bed. We
can give him water tonight and bring food in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll telephone the Sandwiches about him,&rdquo;
said Nyoda, &ldquo;so if they are coming over tomorrow
they won&rsquo;t turn him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But that telephone message was unnecessary, for
at that moment a number of dark figures appeared
in the doorway and after a moment of hesitation,
entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, here are the Sandwiches,&rdquo; exclaimed Nyoda
cordially, advancing with extended hand. &ldquo;We
were just talking about you. Speaking of angels&mdash;you
know the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were just going by,&rdquo; said the Captain (it
was likely that they were &ldquo;just going by&rdquo; that out
of the way place in the rain!) &ldquo;and saw your light
now you&rsquo;ve left the windows uncovered, and thought
we&rsquo;d just step in and inquire our fate. We just
couldn&rsquo;t wait until tomorrow,&rdquo; he finished in a boyish
outburst. &ldquo;Is it going to be the Open Door
for us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, yes,&rdquo; said Nyoda, smiling reassuringly
at this manly lad who was already her favorite,
&ldquo;there wasn&rsquo;t a dissenting vote in the jury box.
We&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but the remainder of her sentence was
drowned in an ear-splitting cheer that was decidedly
less musical than the Winnebago cheers, but none
the less hearty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pedigrees satisfactory, and all that?&rdquo; inquired
the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect,&rdquo; answered Nyoda with twinkling eyes.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve dug up more facts about you than you know
yourselves. So,&rdquo; she added demurely, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re
still minded to &lsquo;know us better,&rsquo; as you flatteringly
remarked on the occasion of our first meeting, why,
we&rsquo;re perfectly willing to be known.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t take immediate possession of your
club room because we&rsquo;ve rented it temporarily to
another don&mdash;another fellow,&rdquo; she said mischievously,
turning the light of the lantern away from
the stall where the donkey was. The boys&rsquo; eager
faces fell a trifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; they answered politely, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s your
privilege.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very nice chap,&rdquo; pursued Nyoda, with a
warning glance at the girls behind her, who were
stuffing their handkerchiefs into their mouths in an
effort not to laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented the boys without enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it anyone we know?&rdquo; asked the Captain politely,
trying to make conversation after a moment
of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you do know him,&rdquo; answered Nyoda.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s here tonight. Would you like to meet him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She led the way to the stall and turned the light
on the donkey. There was a moment of surprised
silence, followed by a perfect explosion of laughter.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you get the donkey with the trousers on?&rdquo;
squeaked Slim in his high thin voice. In the dim
light of the lantern the bandages on the donkey&rsquo;s
front legs looked like a pair of trousers. Then the
girls, after their laugh was out, explained about the
visitor who had come to them from out of the vast,
and the Sandwiches declared that they did not in
the least mind sharing their club room with a needy
donkey, and offered to relieve the girls of the entire
care of him, besides trying to find the owner.</p>
<p>They were as good as their word about taking
care of him, but the weeks slipped by and no amount
of advertising produced anything in the shape of an
owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to adopt him,&rdquo; the Winnebagos decided.
&ldquo;A Camp Fire Donkey sounds thrilling to
me,&rdquo; said Sahwah. &ldquo;Think of all the fun we&rsquo;ll have
with him. As long as the boys don&rsquo;t mind, we can
keep him right here in the stall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we name him?&rdquo; asked Gladys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Call him &lsquo;Wohelo,&rsquo;&rdquo; advised Hinpoha. &ldquo;It was
the spirit of Wohelo that led him to us. From now
on he&rsquo;ll be a symbolic donkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where do we come in on this?&rdquo; inquired the
Captain. &ldquo;We take care of him and he lives in our
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Hinpoha. &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s call
him &lsquo;Sandwich-Wohelo,&rsquo; contracted to &lsquo;Sandhelo.&rsquo;&rdquo;
And &ldquo;Sandhelo&rdquo; he was until the end of the chapter.
His sore legs became very stiff until they were
healed and he hobbled painfully when he walked at
all, which was very seldom. But the scratches healed
at last and the day came when Medmangi took off
the bandages for good, and led him around the
barn for exercise.</p>
<p>Then an amazing thing happened. Sahwah was
upstairs in the Lodge, amusing herself with a mouth organ
she had just discovered in the depths of her
bed. But she had no sooner blown half a dozen
notes when Sandhelo jerked up his head, pulling
the bridle out of Medmangi&rsquo;s hands, and rose up on
his hind legs. Then he walked on his hind legs over
to a box, climbed up on it and sat there with his
feet in the air, like a dog sitting up. Medmangi
screamed and brought the Winnebagos flying from
all directions, to behold the marvel in open-mouthed
astonishment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a trick mule!&rdquo; shouted Sahwah, tumbling
down the ladder in her excitement and never stopping
to pick herself up. &ldquo;Now I know where he
came from. He was with that dog and pony show
that was in town a few weeks ago. He must have
strayed from the show and got left behind. Hats
off to the newest member of the Winnebago group!
We certainly do have a way of attracting all the
best talent in town to our ranks!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">A SANDEBAGO CIRCUS</span></h2>
<p>Just how it started nobody ever knew&mdash;it may
have been Sandhelo&rsquo;s turning out to be a trick mule,
or it may have been because Slim was fat and would
make such a beautiful clown, besides being fine for
a sideshow&mdash;but before they knew it the Winnebagos
and the Sandwich Club were hard at work
getting up a circus. The Sandwiches had taken possession
of their half of the Open Door Lodge and
had converted it into a gymnasium. They had built
it on purpose to reduce Slim, they carefully explained
to their friends, and regularly put him
through a course of exercises strenuous enough to
reduce a hippopotamus to an antelope in three weeks,
but at the end of that time he had gained just five
pounds, so the Sandwiches declared their efforts to
be love&rsquo;s labor lost and left him in peace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>Sandhelo was becoming a well-known and conspicuous
figure in the streets. Hitched to an old
pony cart of Gladys&rsquo;, with bells jingling around
his neck and ribbons flying from his harness, he
never failed to attract a crowd of children. He
had all the vagaries of the artistic temperament,
some of which caused his drivers no little inconvenience.
For one thing, he would not go at all
unless he heard music, and it was no small accomplishment
to drive with one hand and play a mouth organ
with the other if you happened to be alone in
the cart. And then, if he happened to pass anything
unusual in the street he had a way of sitting
back on his haunches and holding up his front feet
and looking at them. As he invariably sat down unexpectedly,
the cart would go on and bump into
him and the shock would throw the driver from her
seat, besides making a great mess of the harness.
Several times he had done this in the middle of a
busy crossing and held up traffic in both directions,
while motormen fumed and policemen threatened,
and Sahwah (it usually was Sahwah, because she
drove him more than the others) played her sweetest
on the mouth organ in an effort to make him
go on. Nothing would make him move until his
curiosity was satisfied and then he would dash off
like an arrow from the bow for half a block, after
which he would slow down and look over his shoulder
to see how his driver was getting on. There
was always such a look of anxious solicitude in his
eye on these occasions that it was impossible to be
angry with him and he continued to exercise his
temperament without reproof.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>After half a dozen of these free shows Sahwah
declared that such an ability to draw a crowd was
worth money, and they had better give a real show
and charge admissions.</p>
<p>The big space in front of the Open Door Lodge
was an ideal place for the ring. Seating arrangements
for the audience gave them some anxiety at
first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to have a grand stand,&rdquo; said the Captain,
who had been chosen Ringmaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t build one,&rdquo; said the Bottomless
Pit. &ldquo;The audience will have to stand through the
performance, and that&rsquo;ll be a grand stand, all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Innovation in circuses,&rdquo; said Nyoda. &ldquo;Have
the audience stand and the circus sit down. Like
the picture of the bride standing while the groom
sprawls at ease in the photographer&rsquo;s gilt chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can get a lot of chairs from a man
who rents them out,&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;He lets
people have them for nothing if it&rsquo;s a charitable enterprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you call a circus a charitable enterprise?&rdquo;
asked Nyoda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ours will be,&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
doing it to make money so we can buy the new
apparatus for the gym, which will surely make Slim
thin, and that surely is charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upstairs in the Lodge the six Winnebagos were
all seated on the bearskin bed having a lively argument
as to who should drive Slim in the Chair-iot
Race. The Chair-iot Race was a grand inspiration
of Sahwah&rsquo;s, who was keen on features in the circus
line. Once, on a rummage, through Gladys&rsquo;
attic, they had found six horsehair covered chairs
furnished with excellent china castors, which caused
the chairs to roll with enchanting speed. Sahwah
now thought of the chairs and conceived the brilliant
idea of harnessing a Sandwich to each one,
seat a Winnebago in the chair, and race six abreast
down the long cement walk from the barn to the
road. The idea was hailed with delight until the
Winnebagos began comparing the merits of the
prospective steeds, and nobody wanted to be the
one to drive Slim and go lumbering along like an
ice-wagon in the rear of the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad the Captain had to be Ringmaster
and can&rsquo;t take part in the show,&rdquo; sighed Hinpoha.
&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;d be enough without Slim.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t dare leave him out, anyway,&rdquo; said
Gladys. &ldquo;It would hurt his feelings. So we&rsquo;ll just
have to draw lots for him, and whoever gets him
will have to make the best of it, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; So
they drew slips of paper from a hat and Hinpoha
drew Slim, just as she had feared right along. Sahwah
drew the Monkey, which suited her down to
the ground, for he was a famous sprinter, and she
lost no time getting the girls to ask the boys whose
names they had drawn in that secret ballot upstairs
to be their steeds in the race. Slim&rsquo;s face lighted
up with such a delighted smile when Hinpoha apparently
chose him for her own that her heart smote
her when she thought how this choice had been
thrust upon her. Slim was already beginning to
learn the bitter truth that nobody loves a fat man.
Nyoda and the Captain plotted the circus parade
and it was a triumph of ingenuity. The advance
bills which they scattered broadcast among their

<br />THE FAMOUS TRICK MULE, AFTER
<br />THE PERFORMANCE</span></p>
<p class="tb">Bottomless Pitt owned a little hand-printing press
and printed wonderful tickets to be sold at five
cents apiece, which Gladys declared were worth the
money as souvenirs, with the circus thrown in extra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you making, a circus tent?&rdquo; asked
Gladys, dropping into the Lodge, where Nyoda sat
stitching together great lengths of red and white
striped material.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; only a clown suit for Slim,&rdquo; laughed Nyoda.
&ldquo;Gracious, how much it does take!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It reminds me of the riddle: &lsquo;If it takes thirty
yards of cloth to make a shirtwaist for an elephant,
etc.,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Gladys. &ldquo;Poor Slim! You
would have died to see him practice his clown stunt
with Sandhelo. You know the boys built him a
tiny red cart with two big wheels, and when he
sat down in it, it tilted way over backward and the
shafts stuck up in the air and pulled poor little
Sandhelo right up off his feet, and there he dangled,
pawing for dear life. But, whatever are you
making, Hinpoha?&rdquo; she finished, examining the thing
which Hinpoha was working on and which resembled
nothing in the universe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Peter&rsquo;s costume,&rdquo; answered Hinpoha;
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s the hind leg of the Kangarooster, you know.
By the way, Nyoda, has a Kangarooster one hump
or two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; answered Nyoda hastily. &ldquo;The
humps are on the &lsquo;Cam&rsquo; part of the Camelk. That
reminds me, have we something to stuff the humps
with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take excelsior,&rdquo; advised Gladys. &ldquo;Dear me,
who&rsquo;s screeching like that downstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all crowded down the ladder at the sound
of a lusty yell from below and found Sahwah hanging
head downward from a heavy hook in the wall.
She had improved a moment&rsquo;s leisure to climb up
to the top of the window with a spray of bittersweet
to see how it would look, and in descending
had caught her skirt on the hook and lost her footing.
The skirt tore through until the stout serge
hem was reached and that offered successful resistance,
and Sahwah hung, as Nyoda remarked, like a
lamb on the spit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I got an idea hanging upside down,&rdquo; were the
first words she gasped as they restored her to the
perpendicular and revived her with peanuts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only way you ever would get an idea,&rdquo;
said Hinpoha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; returned Sahwah, with spirit
&ldquo;Who thought up the Chair-iot Race, I&rsquo;d like to
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop bickering and tell us your idea,&rdquo; said
Nyoda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s this,&rdquo; said Sahwah. &ldquo;Sell hot cocoa
with marshmallows in it after the show. Everybody&rsquo;ll
be cold sitting around. We can make almost
as much money that way as with the circus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lake of hot cocoa with an island of marshmallows
in it is my dream of heaven,&rdquo; said Hinpoha,
clasping her hands in ecstasy. &ldquo;Sahwah,
you&rsquo;re a genius. I yield the palm to you without a
struggle. You have a &lsquo;head in your mind,&rsquo; as absent-minded
old Fuzzytop used to say. There&rsquo;s
nothing in the whole world that&rsquo;ll separate a nickel
from its owner like a cup of hot cocoa with a marshmallow
floating in it on a cold day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Another innovation,&rdquo; said Nyoda. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have
that instead of circus lemonade. See to getting the
supplies, will you, Sahwah dear? I have so many
details to look after now that I simply cannot be
responsible for another thing, or my head will
burst and out will come everything that&rsquo;s safely
packed in now. Come in, Captain. What&rsquo;s on your
mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slim,&rdquo; said the Captain, with a look of comical
despair, as he sat down among the girls. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
he won&rsquo;t do for a Better Baby. He&rsquo;s smashed three
perambulators and a high chair and we can&rsquo;t get
any more. And the biggest size white dress we
could buy in the store won&rsquo;t go half-way around
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nyoda knitted her brows. &ldquo;We simply have to
have a Better Baby,&rdquo; she affirmed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the
best features. We&rsquo;ll drape cheesecloth around him
for a dress and he can play on a quilt on the floor&mdash;I
mean the ground&mdash;instead of being taken for
a ride by his nurse in a perambulator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Slim!&rdquo; said Hinpoha. &ldquo;How many more
things are going to be wished on him? I&rsquo;m afraid
his &lsquo;gall will be divided into three parts,&rsquo; too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would have been a very clever thing for you
to say,&rdquo; remarked the Captain, &ldquo;if it had been original,
but it wasn&rsquo;t. They spring that over at our
school, too. Slim isn&rsquo;t doing any more than the
rest of us at that. Only he&rsquo;s so conspicuous that
everything he does seems like a lot more than it
really is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are the tickets going?&rdquo; asked Sahwah.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve sold over a hundred,&rdquo; announced the
Captain with pride. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re famous people, we
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself,&rdquo; said Sahwah. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
we who are the attraction, though&mdash;it&rsquo;s Sandhelo.
I rode him through the streets and sold nearly fifty
tickets to the children that followed us. They&rsquo;re
all attracted by the promise of a free ride after the
show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll probably take all evening to give them the
ride, and we&rsquo;ll never get to that jubilation spread
we&rsquo;re going to have after the show, but we have to
make our word good,&rdquo; said Nyoda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put them on four at once and we&rsquo;ll get done
somehow,&rdquo; said Sahwah.</p>
<p>Hinpoha laid down her sewing and stretched her
arms above her head. &ldquo;I never knew circuses were
such a pile of work,&rdquo; she sighed.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Wohelo means work,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">So dig like a Turk,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>chanted Sahwah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I move we all go to the &lsquo;movies&rsquo; tonight and see
&lsquo;If I Were King,&rsquo;&rdquo; continued Hinpoha.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Nyoda briefly, checking up on her
fingers the things she still had to do. &ldquo;I still have
to evolve a tail for the Salmonkey and a frontispiece
for the Camelk, make four banners, rehearse
the living statuary, make a bonnet for the Better
Baby, teach the Crabbit how to hop and crawl at
the same time and make a costume for the bareback
rider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d come and help you,&rdquo; said Sahwah, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re
going to have a test in Latin tomorrow and I have
to cram tonight. I&rsquo;ll just have time to practice with
the band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A test in time saves nine,&rdquo; murmured Hinpoha.
&ldquo;What are the Sandwiches doing now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Erecting the flying trapeze,&rdquo; answered Sahwah,
looking out of the window. &ldquo;Captain is hanging by
his eyebrow to the top of a pole and Bottomless Pitt
is standing below, waiting to catch him when he
falls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain caught her eye, as she leaned over
the sill and shouted:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;All right below,</p>
<p class="t0">O Wohelo,</p>
<p class="t0">Now <i>please</i> go mix some pancake dough!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; called Sahwah cheerily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
soon smell something doughing!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Nyoda and Gladys went home on an errand, and
Hinpoha, worn out with her arduous labors with
the needle, stretched out on the bearskin bed and
fell sound asleep in the warmth of the fire. Sahwah
puttered about collecting the ingredients for
flapjacks to make a treat for the boys, who had
worked like Trojans ever since school was out. The
wood in the fireplace had burned down to lovely
glowing embers, and she laid the toaster on top of
them to act as a rest for the frying-pan. The Captain,
tying ropes into the branches of the big tree
just outside of the window, looked in and admired
the scene. Hinpoha, with her marvellous red curls
falling around her face in the light of the fire, looked
like a sleeping princess in a fairy tale, and Sahwah,
holding her dish of batter in one hand and skilfully
putting grease into the pan with the other, was a
cheery little housewife indeed. Through the half-open
window he could hear her singing &ldquo;A Warrior
Bold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment he looked in, filled with whole-souled
admiration for these many-sided girls who were his
new friends, and then without warning something
happened inside. The panful of sizzling fat suddenly
burst into a sheet of flame that left the confines
of the fireplace and seemed to leap all around
Sahwah. A burning spark shot out and fell into a
pile of cheesecloth lying on the floor at the far side
of the room, and it blazed up instantly, the flames
enveloping the sleeping Hinpoha. It took less than
a moment for the Captain to spring down from the
tree, run into the barn and up the ladder. But it
was too late for him to do anything. In the twinkling
of an eye Sahwah had seized the burning
cheesecloth and flung it into the fireplace, thrown a
bearskin rug over Hinpoha and now stood calmly
pouring sand from a bucket on top of the burning
fat in the pan. And all the while she was doing it
she had never stopped singing! The Captain stood
still in his amazement and listened idly to the words:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;So what care I, though death be nigh?</p>
<p class="t0">I&rsquo;ll live for love or die&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>A hoarse sound made her turn around and she
saw the Captain standing beside her with face pale
as ashes. The dreadful sight he had seen from the
tree when the room seemed filled with flame was
still in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you manage to keep so cool and do
everything so quickly?&rdquo; he asked in amazement.</p>
<p>Sahwah laughed at his expression of astonishment.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the first fire I&rsquo;ve put out,&rdquo; she
said calmly. &ldquo;We always keep both water and sand
on hand whenever we have an open fire, to prevent
serious accidents. Having the cheesecloth go up at
the same time rather complicated matters, but I got
it into the fireplace without any trouble. I don&rsquo;t
know what made the fat in the pan take fire; it&rsquo;s
never done that before up here. But don&rsquo;t worry;
I&rsquo;ll get your flapjacks made, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>The Captain looked at her with more admiration
than ever. &ldquo;Most girls would have been in a faint
by that time, and have had to be doused with smelling
salts,&rdquo; he told the Sandwiches later, &ldquo;instead of
coolly promising you your flapjacks anyway and
apologizing for the delay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your hands are burned!&rdquo; he exclaimed in concern,
as he saw Sahwah looking ruefully at her
blackened fingers. &ldquo;Let me do something for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing serious,&rdquo; said Sahwah, turning them
down so he could not see the blistered palms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are, too!&rdquo; persisted the Captain. &ldquo;Have
you any oil handy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the First Aid box over there,&rdquo; said Sahwah.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in that bottle labeled <span class="sc">A Burned Child
Dreads the Fire</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain returned with cotton and gauze and
the oil and proceeded to bandage the scorched hands
that had been so quick to avert disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Hinpoha be furious when she wakes up
and finds her costume that she worked so hard on
all burned up?&rdquo; she said, as he wound the bandages
under her direction. &ldquo;I hated to throw it into the
fire, but it had to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d better not be furious,&rdquo; returned the Captain.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got you to thank that she didn&rsquo;t burn
up herself. She had a close call that time, and if
you hadn&rsquo;t snatched that burning rag off her and
covered her with a rug I&rsquo;d hate to think what would
have happened. I tell you it&rsquo;s great to be able to
do the right thing at the right time. A lot of people
talk about what they would do in an emergency, but
very few of them ever do it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Sahwah coolly, holding up her
hands and inspecting the bandages with a critical
eye, &ldquo;there is an emergency before us right now.
Suppose you stop talking and get busy and fry those
pancakes for the boys. They&rsquo;re dying of starvation
outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain started, blushed and looked at her
keenly to see if she were making fun of him, and
then fell to work without a word finishing Sahwah&rsquo;s
interrupted labor.</p>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">THE ARRIVAL OF KATHERINE</span></h2>
<p>Preparations were completed and the day for
the presentation of the greatest show on earth had
arrived. It was crisply cool, but clear and sunshiny,
as the last Saturday in beloved October should be;
and not too cold to sit still and witness an out-of-doors
performance. Tickets had sold with such
gratifying readiness that a second edition had been
necessary, and the Committee on Seating Arrangements
was nearly in despair over providing enough
seats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; declared Bottomless Pitt, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
done the best we could and half of them will still
have to stand. It&rsquo;ll be a case of &lsquo;first come, first
served.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sahwah and Hinpoha, their arms filled with bundles
of &ldquo;props,&rdquo; which they had spent the morning
in collecting, sank wearily down at a table in the
&ldquo;Neapolitan&rdquo; soda dispensary and ordered their favorite
sundaes. &ldquo;Now, are you perfectly sure we
have everything?&rdquo; asked Hinpoha, between spoonfuls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Better Baby&rsquo;s rattle,&rdquo; recounted Sahwah,
identifying her parcels by feeling of them,
&ldquo;the Magician&rsquo;s natural hair a foot long, the china
eggs he finds in the lady&rsquo;s handbag, the bareback
rider&rsquo;s spangles, and&mdash;O Hinpoha!&rdquo; she cried in
dismay, dropping her spoon on the tile floor with a
great clatter, &ldquo;we forgot the red, white and blue
cockade for Sandhelo. I&rsquo;ll have to go back to Nelson&rsquo;s
and get it. Dear me, it&rsquo;s eleven o&rsquo;clock now
and we still have to go out home and dress. And
the marshmallows have to be bought yet; that&rsquo;s another
thing I promised Nyoda I&rsquo;d see about. Won&rsquo;t
you please get them, Hinpoha, while I run up to
Nelson&rsquo;s? There&rsquo;s a dear. Get them at Raymond&rsquo;s&mdash;theirs
are the freshest; and then you had better go
right on home without waiting for me. It will take
me a little longer, but I&rsquo;ll hurry as fast as I can.
And please tell Nyoda that I didn&rsquo;t forget the
marshmallows this time; I just turned the responsibility
over to you.&rdquo; And Sahwah gathered up her
bundles and retraced her steps toward the big up-town
store, while Hinpoha took her way to Raymond&rsquo;s.
Five pounds of marshmallows make a
pretty big box, and Hinpoha had several other parcels
to carry. She had them all laid out on the
counter with an eye to tying some of them together
to facilitate transportation when a voice suddenly
called out: &ldquo;Dorothy! Dorothy Bradford!&rdquo; She
turned and saw Miss Parker, one of the teachers
at Washington High, at the other end of the counter.
&ldquo;Come and meet my cousin,&rdquo; said Miss Parker,
and brought forward a young girl she had with her.
&ldquo;This is Katherine Adams,&rdquo; said Miss Parker.
&ldquo;Katherine, I would like you to meet one of my
pupils, Dorothy Bradford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hinpoha acknowledged the introduction cordially,
but it was all she could do to suppress a smile at
Katherine&rsquo;s appearance. She was an extremely tall,
lanky girl, narrow chested and stoop shouldered,
with scanty straw-colored hair drawn into a tight
knot at the back of her neck, and pale, near-sighted
eyes peering through glasses. She wore a long drab-colored
coat, cut as severely plain as a man&rsquo;s, and
a narrow-brimmed felt sailor hat. She wore no
gloves and her hands were large and bony. Her
shoes&mdash;Hinpoha looked twice in her astonishment
to make sure&mdash;yes, there was no mistake, the shoes
she had on were not mates! One was a cloth-top
button and the other a heavy laced walking boot.
Miss Parker followed Hinpoha&rsquo;s surprised glance
and looked distressed. But Katherine was not at all
disconcerted when she discovered the discrepancy in
her footgear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you get for interrupting me in the
middle of my dressing,&rdquo; she said coolly. &ldquo;Now,
I&rsquo;ve forgotten which pair I intended to wear.&rdquo; She
had an odd, husky voice, that made everything she
said sound funny.</p>
<p>Miss Parker seemed rather anxious that her
cousin should make a good impression on Hinpoha.
Katherine was from Spencer, Arkansas, she explained,
and had gone as far in school as she could
out there and had now come east to stay with her
cousin and take the last year in high school. Hinpoha
promised to introduce her around to the girls
in the class, with her eyes on the clock all the while
and her mind on the performance she should be helping
to prepare that minute instead of standing there
talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come to our circus this afternoon?&rdquo;
she said politely, fishing among the small &ldquo;props&rdquo;
in her handbag. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a ticket. It&rsquo;s going to be
in the big field at the corner of May and &mdash;&mdash;th
streets. Come into the barn if you come and I&rsquo;ll
introduce you to some of my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Miss Parker and her caricature of a cousin finally
departed, and Hinpoha hastily gathered up her bundles.
Something about the package of marshmallows
struck her as unfamiliar, and she examined it
in consternation. It certainly was not her package,
though like it in shape. Somebody had taken hers
by mistake. She looked around the store and was
just in time to see her box being carried out the
front door under the arm of a woman. Hinpoha
gathered her packages into her arms hit and miss
and rushed after her. But impeded as she was she
got stuck in the revolving door and was delayed a
full minute before she escaped to the sidewalk. She
was just in time to see the object of her pursuit
board a car at the corner. Before Hinpoha could
reach the corner the car had started. Hinpoha
stamped her foot with vexation, mostly directed
toward Miss Parker and her freak cousin for taking
her attention away from her belongings. Then she
considered. The car the woman had boarded must
make a loop and come out a block below and it would
be possible to catch it there. Hinpoha puffed along
the sidewalk at a great rate, worming her way
through the Saturday noon crowds and colliding
with people right and left. She reached the corner
just as the car did and made a mad dash over the
pavement, dodging in among wagons and automobiles
at dire peril of life and limb. She scrambled
aboard and landed sprawling on the back platform,
while her bundles scattered over the floor in every
direction. Breathless and embarrassed, she gathered
them up and entered the car just in time to see
the lady carrying her box of marshmallows get out
of the front door. Hinpoha made a wild dash for
the rear exit, but the door was closed and the car
already in motion. She rang the bell frantically, at
the same time following the woman with her eyes
to see in which direction she went. The car finally
released her two blocks up street, and then began
the mad chase back again. Poor Hinpoha was
never built for speed; her breath gave out and she
developed an agonizing pain in her side. Her bundles
weighed her down and her hat flopped into her
eyes. Chugging along thus she ran smartly into
someone and again her packages covered the sidewalk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, excuse me!&rdquo; she gasped, struggling to get
her hat back on her head. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see where I
was going. <i>Why, Captain</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; For it was none
other than he with whom she had collided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty well loaded down, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said the
Captain, stooping to pick up the litter on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind them,&rdquo; said Hinpoha hastily, &ldquo;go
after <i>her</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go after <i>her</i>?&rdquo; repeated the Captain in a tone of
bewilderment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>Hinpoha pointed speechlessly up the street and
then with a mighty effort regained a speck of her
breath and panted &ldquo;Lady&mdash;blue coat&mdash;plush collar&mdash;our
marshmallows&mdash;left this&mdash;Raymond&rsquo;s&mdash;go get
them,&rdquo; and, shoving the stranger&rsquo;s package into his
hands, she indicated with waving arms that he was
to pursue the lady in question and regain the club&rsquo;s
property. The Captain started off obediently,
though her explanation was not yet clear in his
mind, but the truth flashed over him when he presently
overtook a lady that fitted the description just
turning into the door of Raymond&rsquo;s store with a
large package under her arm, and he soon made his
errand known and recovered the marshmallows.
She was just in the act of returning them to Raymond&rsquo;s,
having discovered her mistake.</p>
<p>Hinpoha was out in front when the Captain
emerged from the store, and she surrendered her
bundles to him gratefully, saying with a breathless
sigh, &ldquo;Boys <i>are</i> useful to have around once in a
while, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only once in a while?&rdquo; asked the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe twice in a while, then,&rdquo; said Hinpoha
graciously.</p>
<p>Hinpoha arrived on the scene of action so late
that there was no time to press her for explanations;
she was summarily hustled out of her street clothes
and into her orchestra costume. The audience was
arriving in crowds and the Sandwiches, who were
detailed as ticket takers, had much to do to keep
legions of small boys from climbing the fence and
seeing the show without the formality of buying a
ticket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>The Grand Parade, &ldquo;including every single member
of the entire show,&rdquo; was scheduled to start
promptly at two. The parade was necessarily held
in sections, as all hands were needed for each section.
The clock in a neighboring steeple had not
finished chiming the hour when there was an unearthly
blare of trumpets and crashing of drums,
and the band issued from the entrance of the Open
Door Lodge. Nyoda led the band and made a stunning
drum major in a fur hat a foot high, made out
of a muff. The members of the band were dressed
as Spanish troubadours in costumes of blinding scarlet,
with their instruments hung around their neck
by ribbons. They marched around the ring at a
lively pace, playing the music of a popular football
song, which made the audience cheer wildly, for it
was largely composed of students from the two great
rival schools, Washington High and Carnegie Mechanic.
In the wake of the troubadours stumbled an
enormously fat clown in a suit half red and half
white, blowing up a rubber bladder, which emitted
a plaintive squawk. Loud applause greeted every
move the clown made and when he accidentally
stumbled into a hole and measured his length on the
ground the small boys shrieked in ecstasy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>The band made a stately and melodious exit in
the House of the Open Door and once inside broke
ranks in haste to prepare for the second section of
the parade&mdash;the procession of the animals. This
was a much more complicated matter than the band
had been, but it had been so well rehearsed that
the crowd, who were being amused by the antics
of the clown, had not time to grow impatient before
they were ready. Shrieks of delight went up
at the appearance of the five ferocious animals from
Nowhere&mdash;<span class="sc">The Camelk</span>, <span class="sc">The Crabbit</span>, <span class="sc">The Alligatortoise</span>,
<span class="sc">The Kangarooster</span> and <span class="sc">The Salmonkey</span>,
and they had to go around the ring five
times before being allowed to retire. The parade
being such an unqualified success, it is needless to
say that the circus proper went even better. The
actors had all worked themselves up into the right
mood for it.</p>
<p>The magician gave more entertainment than he
had counted on, for the mice, which he had concealed
in his pocket ready to produce from under
the folded handkerchief, bit him before their turn
in the show came, and the beholders were startled
to see the magician suddenly spring into the air,
uttering a wild yell and, thrusting his hand into his
hip pocket, throw the cause of the disturbance half-way
across the ring. The Fattest Man on Earth,
who was Slim, with the addition of several pillows
fore and aft, mounted the small stage and laboriously
sat on a toothpick, breaking down the stage
in the process; and the Inja Rubber Man did such
amazing contortions that the audience began to
hold their breath for fear he would never come untangled
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>When it happened to be her turn to go out in
one of the numbers Hinpoha looked the audience
over to see if Katherine Adams had come in response
to her invitation, but she did not see her.
But, while looking for Katherine, her eye was
caught by a strange figure, the like of which she
had never seen before. She was a woman, old and
bent, and dressed in such old-fashioned clothes that
she looked like a caricature out of a funny page.
She had on a tight green basque, which flared out
below the waist in a ripple and a very full red skirt,
held out in a ridiculous curve by that atrocity of
bygone days known as a &ldquo;bustle.&rdquo; She was climbing
stiffly up and down among the spectators trying
to sell papers which she was crying in a shrill voice.
As she went up and down among the benches she
held up her skirt in her hand, disclosing purple
stockings and enormous flapping slippers. Wherever
she went she was followed by a ripple of laughter;
the audience seemed to be getting as much fun
out of her as they were out of the show. Hinpoha
told Nyoda about it when she was in the barn again
and Nyoda asked all the players not to do anything
to drive her away, as she was no doubt trying to
make an honest living by selling papers wherever
there was a crowd, and she was adding an unexpected
touch to the circus to amuse the audience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>The bareback rider proved a real sensation. Up
to that time the numbers had merely been in the nature
of stunts&mdash;clever and original and highly diverting,
and yet something which any group of
young people could produce. But here was something
different. Veronica was so dark that in her
costume she looked like a real gypsy, and as she
was not yet well known she was not recognized.
She came in riding a beautiful black horse that belonged
to Mr. Evans, and, after galloping around
the ring several times and making him rear up on
his hind legs until the audience thought she must
slide off, she set him to leaping obstacles, keeping
her seat all the while with amazing ease. There
was a touch of realism in her act, too, which made
the audience tingle for a while. In their eagerness
to see the horse and the daring rider the children
down in the front row had pressed forward until
they were fairly under the ropes. Without warning
a little girl lost her balance and fell out into the ring,
rolling right into the path of the galloping horse.
An exclamation of horror went up from the crowd,
and many covered their eyes with their hands. The
others, gazing as if fascinated, saw the horse in
obedience to a quick command leap into the air with
all four feet and come down several feet beyond the
little form on the ground. Shouts rose up from
every side and cheers for the skilful horsewoman
who had been able to avert a tragedy when it was
too late to turn aside. But Veronica sat unmoved,
a graceful statue on the beautiful horse, looking out
over the audience with brooding eyes that saw them
not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Of course the <i>piece de resistance</i> of the whole
show was the trick mule, Sandhelo. He had been
the most widely advertised feature and had been
the means of selling the most tickets. The small
boys came lured by the promise of a free ride after
the show and could hardly wait for that time to
come. His appearance in the ring was hailed with
tumultuous applause. Led by the clown, who played
the mouth organ constantly to assure his continuous
locomotion, he did his tricks over and over again,
lying down as if dead when Slim played &ldquo;John
Brown&rsquo;s Body,&rdquo; and springing to his feet with a
lively bray when he played &ldquo;Yankee Doodle&rdquo;; and
sitting up on the table and waving his fore feet at
the audience while he tossed a lump of sugar on his
nose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>Then the clown tried to ride him and fell off,
first on one side and then the other, and after several
vain attempts offered a quarter to anyone in
the audience who would come out and ride him
around the ring. As the players along knew that
Sandhelo would only go to music, they anticipated
no little fun from this business. Sandhelo was perfectly
safe to ride&mdash;he was as gentle as a kitten&mdash;but
his refusal to stir when commanded made him
appear a very balky mule indeed, and there was no
response to Slim&rsquo;s invitation for somebody to come
out and ride him. Even the small boys, who were
eager to ride him, preferred to wait until the show
was over before making the trial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t all come at once,&rdquo; appealed Slim in derision.
&ldquo;One at a time, please. Who&rsquo;ll ride the famous
trick mule, Sandhelo, around the ring and win
the handsome prize of twenty-five cents, a whole
quarter of a dollar?&rdquo; Still no volunteers. Sandhelo
yawned and looked bored to death. Slim
stretched out his hands to the audience imploringly.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a commotion at one end of
the seats and down from the top of the picnic tables,
where the raised seats were, there climbed the little
old woman who had gone around selling papers.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ride him for twenty-five cents,&rdquo; she cackled in
her high shrill voice. And she hobbled across the
ring to where Sandhelo stood. The players were
ready to hug themselves with joy. Here was a real
circus-y touch they had not counted on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid she&rsquo;ll get hurt?&rdquo; whispered
Hinpoha to Nyoda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger,&rdquo; returned Nyoda. &ldquo;Sandhelo won&rsquo;t
go a step without the mouth organ.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>The little old woman, her back bent almost double,
shuffled over and grasped Sandhelo, not by the
bridle, but by the cockade on his head. Then she
suddenly straightened up and a gasp of astonishment
went around the circle. She was taller than
the tallest of them. Without assistance from anyone
she climbed on Sandhelo&rsquo;s back and sat with
her face toward his tail. The audience, suspecting
that it was a &ldquo;put-up job,&rdquo; and this was another
stunt, roared its appreciation, but the players looked
at each other in utter bewilderment. Who was this
strange character?</p>
<p>Sandhelo was a very small donkey, standing no
higher than a Shetland pony, and when the old lady
was seated on his back her feet dragged on the
ground. Calmly crossing them underneath his body,
she gave his tail a smart jerk, accompanied by the
shrill command, &ldquo;Giddap!&rdquo; Sandhelo, mortified to
death at the undignified position of his rider, had
but one idea in his mind&mdash;to escape from the gibing
crowd and hide his head in his stable. Around the
ring he flew as fast as his tiny legs would carry him,
the old woman sticking to him like a burr, her bonnet
strings flying in the wind, her big slippers flapping
against his sides, and her shrill voice urging
him on to greater speed. The act brought down
the house and a whole row of folding camp chairs
collapsed under the strain of the applause.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Beside himself with rage and shame, Sandhelo
bolted into the barn and carried his strange rider
into the midst of the company of players. Sliding
off his back, she looked around the ring of curious
faces before her with little twinkling gray eyes.
Then she held out her hand suggestively. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
the quarter I git fer ridin&rsquo; the mule?&rdquo; she asked.
Something in her voice awakened a memory in
Hinpoha&rsquo;s mind. In a twinkling she was carried
back to the incident at Raymond&rsquo;s that noon when
Miss Parker stopped to present her cousin from the
west. Surely there never were two such voices!
At the same time Hinpoha noticed that the old woman&rsquo;s
gray hair was sliding back on her head, and a
long wisp of yellowish hair was hanging out underneath.
She stared at the curious figure in growing
wonder, and the woman stared back at her with a
knowing grin that became wider every moment.
Then with a quick movement the old woman
snatched off a gray wig, mopped a damp handkerchief
over her face, produced a pair of glasses from
some pocket in the wide skirt, and stood before them
the same awkward, ungainly creature that Hinpoha
had met that noon. It was Katherine Adams, Miss
Parker&rsquo;s cousin.</p>
<p>Such a babel there was when Hinpoha recognized
the strange comedian and presented her to the others!
The waiting audience was completely forgotten
as they listened fascinated while Katherine explained
how she had come &ldquo;by special invitation&rdquo; to
the circus and had decided that people who had
&ldquo;pep&rdquo; enough to get up a circus were worth knowing,
and the best way to get acquainted with the
players was to be in the show herself. So she had
joined the company without the formality of being
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re appointed assistant clown for the remainder
of the circus,&rdquo; said Nyoda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re invited to the spread upstairs afterwards,&rdquo;
said Hinpoha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for the Chair-iot Race,&rdquo; said the Captain
warningly, and the players returned to their
duties with a guilty start. The new comedian
proved such a diversion and put the regular clown
up to so many tricks that he would never have
thought of by himself, that the audience refused
to go home when the big show was over, and called
for encore after encore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get her to sell cocoa,&rdquo; suggested Gladys;
&ldquo;they&rsquo;ll buy from her when they wouldn&rsquo;t from
us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>So Katherine, who up until a few hours ago had
never heard of the Winnebagos and Sandwiches, did
more for them in the way of dispensing cups of
cocoa at five cents a cup than they were able to do
for themselves. She made such inimitably droll
speeches in her efforts to advertise her wares that
the audience crowded around her just to hear her
talk, and bought and bought until the huge kettles
were empty and the paper box till was full. The
small boys crowded around the Ringmaster, demanding
their ride on the trick mule, and, tearing
himself away from the fascinating orator, he betook
himself to the barn, followed by the whole
string of would-be riders. But when he arrived
there the stall was empty and Sandhelo was nowhere
to be found. Loud chorus of disappointment
from the small boys. The Captain turned their interest
in Sandhelo to account by enlisting them in
the search for him, but it was vain. Nowhere
could they find a trace of him. His shame at the
indignity heaped upon him that afternoon had been
too great. Finding his stall left open in the excitement
he had escaped and wandered off while the
attention of everyone was riveted on the antics of
the new comedian, and hid his head among new
scenes and faces. The small boys finally gave up
and went home, partly consoled by the assurance
that if Sandhelo ever turned up again the promised
ride would still be theirs, and the players, rather
exhausted, but exulting over the success of the performance,
gathered in the Winnebago room of the
Open Door Lodge for the jollification spread.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Katherine Adams was the lioness of the evening.
Begged for a speech, she obligingly mounted the
table and held a discourse that left her hearers limp
with merriment. What she said was sidesplitting
enough, but her gestures, her expression and her
voice were beyond description. She spoke in a lazy
southern drawl, mixed up with a nasal twang, and
the peculiarly veiled, husky quality of her voice gave
it a sound the like of which was never heard before.
She still wore the big flapping slippers and had much
ado to keep them on when she climbed on the table
with the mincing air of a young miss making an elocution
lesson. She planted her feet carefully, heels
together and toes apart, taking several minutes in
the operation, and then surveyed them with a silly
smirk of satisfaction that was convulsing. When
her discourse became a little heated the feet suddenly
flew around and toed in until both heels and
toes were in a straight line. At the ripple of laughter
which this called forth she looked down at her
feet with a sad, pained expression and carefully set
them right again. A few moments later she again
waxed eloquent and again the feet turned, seemingly
of themselves, and this time her toes pointed outward
until toes and heels were all one straight line.
The shrieks of delight made her look down again,
with that same puzzled, pained expression, and again
she set them right in an affected manner.</p>
<p>When the speech was over the boys and girls
begged her to do it again, and kept her speechifying
until she declared she had no voice left to whisper.
&ldquo;You know I have to be very careful of my
voice,&rdquo; she said in a tone of confiding simplicity.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so sweet that I&rsquo;m afraid of cracking it all the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>Katherine was too good to be true. &ldquo;Just like a
character out of a book,&rdquo; the delighted Winnebagos
whispered to one another. Before the evening was
over they had unanimously decided to urge&mdash;not
merely invite, mind you, but urge&mdash;her to become a
Winnebago. Katherine was delighted with the idea
and accepted the invitation with another convulsing
speech. It seemed incredible to the girls that they
had met her just that afternoon. It seemed as if
they had known her always. She fitted into their
group like a thumb on a hand. She was plied with
slumgullion and every other delicacy, and her health
was drunk in numerous cups of cocoa. The continual
flow of banter which the Winnebagos usually
kept up among themselves was hushed, and everyone
was willing to put the soft pedal on her own
speech if only Katherine would talk some more. She
told fascinating things about her life on a big stock
farm out in Arkansas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any Indians around there?&rdquo; asked
Veronica, whose ideas of the American Far West
were rather hazy and romantic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indians!&rdquo; said Katherine. &ldquo;I should say there
were! They&rsquo;re something terrible. Why, you don&rsquo;t
dare hang your clothes on the line, because the Indians
will shoot them full of arrows! And then,&rdquo;
she continued, as she saw Veronica&rsquo;s eyes becoming
saucerlike, &ldquo;there are all kind of wild animals out
there, too. We can&rsquo;t keep milk standing around in
the pantry because the wildcats come in and drink it
up, and the bears shed their hair all over the carpet!
Why, one day I came in from the yard and there
was a rattlesnake curled up on the piano stool!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>The Winnebagos and the Sandwiches doubled up
with merriment at her awful &ldquo;yarns,&rdquo; but Veronica
believed every word of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Katherine, you awful thing, I&rsquo;m in love with
you,&rdquo; cried Hinpoha, in rather mixed metaphor,
and drew her down on the bearskin bed beside her.
&ldquo;Goodness, Veronica, don&rsquo;t look so excited. All
the Indians there are in this country now are on
reservations, and they&rsquo;re entirely peaceable. You
mustn&rsquo;t believe a word she says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jollification supper ended in a hilarious Virginia
Reel, which hardly anyone could dance for
laughing at Katherine&rsquo;s big slippers, as she shuffled
up and down the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a day this has been,&rdquo; sighed Hinpoha to
Gladys, with whom she was spending the night, as
she sank down on the bed with all her clothes on.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made enough money to equip the Sandwiches&rsquo;
gym be-yoo-tifully; we&rsquo;ve made Veronica
famous as a horsewoman; we&rsquo;ve lost our trick mule
and gained a new member for the Winnebagos. In
the classic words of our gallant Captain, I think
that&rsquo;s &lsquo;going some.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">A MORAL OBLIGATION</span></h2>
<p>Katherine&rsquo;s entry into High School life was a
complete success&mdash;one of those rare, astonishing
successes that happen about once in a decade. The
regular members of the class, who have been together
since the beginning, will by constant effort
have attained a fair measure of popularity by the
fourth year, when suddenly a personality will appear
out of the vast and seize and hold the center of the
stage. Katherine&rsquo;s spectacular exploit at the Sandebago
Circus was heralded far and wide, and when
she entered school the following Monday morning
she found herself already famous. Everywhere
she was pointed out as &ldquo;the girl who had ridden
the donkey,&rdquo; &ldquo;the girl with the funny voice,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
girl who made the screaming speeches.&rdquo; Teachers
agreed unanimously that she was the most erratically
brilliant student they had ever had in their
classes&mdash;when she could remember to turn her work
in. Her compositions were read out in class and
brought down the house. When she rose to recite
you could hear a pin drop. It was an open secret
that the two English teachers had drawn lots to see
who would get her, and not a few pupils suddenly
discovered conflicts in their recitations and got themselves
changed into the class where Katherine was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>Her absent-mindedness soon became proverbial.
Odd shoes&mdash;gloves of two different colors&mdash;hat on
hind side before, or somebody else&rsquo;s hat altogether&mdash;these
were everyday occurrences. Her friends
told with chuckles how she had climbed one flight
of stairs too many on her way to Math class and
walked into a Freshman English class, her mind
busy working out the solution of a problem in geometry.
When some other Katherine was called upon
to recite she rose solemnly and, going to the board,
gave a masterly demonstration of a knotty theorem
in solid geometry, and then marched out with the
class, serenely unconscious of her mistake, oblivious
to the laughter of the class and the amusement of
the teacher, who let her go on without interruption
to see how far she would go. Her bewilderment
when asked by the regular geometry teacher to explain
why she had cut class that morning was comical.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>Possessing neither beauty, style, pretty clothes,
nor all the dozen other things that make the ordinary
girl popular, her very unusualness gave her a
distinction, and inside of two weeks she was the
best-known girl in the whole school. To be counted
as one of her friends was an honor, and to be
able to say, &ldquo;Katherine told me this,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Katherine
did this up at our house,&rdquo; was to incite the envy
of less favored ones. The Uranians, the most exclusive
and select girl&rsquo;s society in the school, voted
her in as a member because they must have all the
prominent girls, although they generally scorned
both worth and brains, if clothed in poor garments,
and great was their chagrin to find that their disdained
rivals, the clever and democratic Dramatic
Club, had held a special meeting and taken her in
the afternoon before. Urania had not noticed that
Katherine had been wearing the Dramatic Club pin
a whole day because she had stuck it over a hole in
her stocking which she did not have time to mend.</p>
<p>How the Winnebagos exulted because Hinpoha
had been polite enough to invite her to the circus
and she had consequently landed in their bosom the
first thing! No other group of girls would ever
know her as intimately as they would. The Camp
Fire idea appealed to her from the start. The Open
Door Lodge was a paradise for her. The ladder
stairs were a constant source of delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would think you had never climbed a ladder
before,&rdquo; said Hinpoha, watching curiously as
Katherine climbed up and down and up again just
for the fun of the thing. Katherine draped her
feet around a rung to support herself and sat on the
top bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never climbed a ladder!&rdquo; said Hinpoha incredulously.
&ldquo;Why, where did you live?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In Arkansas,&rdquo; answered Katherine significantly.
&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;that until I came
east I had never seen a flight of stairs? <i>I had never
seen a flight of stairs!</i>&rdquo; she repeated, as Hinpoha
and the other girls in the Lodge gasped unbelievingly.
&ldquo;We lived in a one-story house, the floor
level with the ground, so you just walked in from
the outside without going up steps. The house was
in the middle of a big farm, as level and flat as this
floor. I rode ten miles to school and that was built
just like our house. Oh, of course I knew there
were such things as stairs, because I had seen them
in pictures, but until I came here I had never seen
any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t you see any when you went traveling?&rdquo;
asked Hinpoha, still incredulous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never went traveling,&rdquo; returned Katherine. &ldquo;It
took considerable hustling to stay right where we
were. One year the locusts ate up everything, down
to the clothes on the line, and we couldn&rsquo;t get
enough feed to fatten the stock; the next year there
were prairie fires that licked the earth as clean as a
plate; one year the cattle all died of disease, and so
on. It wasn&rsquo;t until this year that we came out ahead
enough to send me here to school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when the girls heard what a hard time she
had had they adored her more than ever because
she could be so funny when she had had so little
to be funny about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Another thing that charmed her beyond measure
was the color of the autumn leaves. The Winnebagos
could hardly pull her past a tree. &ldquo;There
was only one tree in sight on our farm,&rdquo; she would
tell them, &ldquo;and that wasn&rsquo;t green like the trees are
in the east; it was just a dusty, greenish gray. And
the leaves didn&rsquo;t turn colors in the fall; they just
withered up and dropped off. Oh-h-h, look at that
one over there&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it just too gorgeous for
words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we said that both teachers and pupils regarded
Katherine as too good to be true, we should
have made one exception. That exception was Miss
Snively, the Senior Oratory teacher. Most of the
teachers were liked by some scholars and disliked
by some, according to disposition or circumstance;
but all pupils agreed heartily that they did not like
Miss Snively. She was neither old nor bad looking;
in fact, she was rather handsome when you
saw her for the first time, but she was so bitingly
sarcastic that her classes stood in fear and trembling
of being singled out for some poisoned shaft.
Sarcasm and ridicule are the most deadly weapons
to use against boys and girls of the high school age.
They are not old enough to know how to come back,
and can only nurse the smart and writhe impotently.
And of all classes to have a sarcastic teacher,
Senior Oratory is the worst. It is bad enough to
stand up and make a speech with appropriate gestures
before a sympathetic teacher who corrects
diplomatically and never, never laughs, but to have
one who eyes you coldly all the while and then gets
up and does it the way you did, only ten times
worse&mdash;more buckets of tears had been shed over
Senior Oratory than all other subjects put together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>When Katherine entered the class Miss Snively
took immediate exception to her voice. Miss Snively&rsquo;s
particular hobby was Woman&rsquo;s Voice. Hers
was high and artificially sweet&mdash;it fairly oozed syrup&mdash;and
she did her level best to make her girl pupils
imitate it. So when Katherine began reading in her
husky nasal drawl, Miss Snively promptly read the
piece after her, imitating her voice as best she could,
and then looked around the room for the laughter
of the pupils which would complete Katherine&rsquo;s mortification.
But nobody laughed. They all sympathized
with Katherine. They had been in her shoes
themselves. The blood mounted to Katherine&rsquo;s temples
when she realized that Miss Snively was deliberately
making fun of her, and a hurt look came into
her eyes. She was sensitive about her voice, even
if she did get endless fun out of it. When Miss
Snively handed her the book again and bade her in
sarcastic tones to read further for the edification of
the class, Katherine sat silent. To her horror she
found there was a lump in her throat and she would
most likely break down utterly if she tried to say
a word. She did not mean to be stubborn&mdash;she was
only waiting for control of her voice, for she was
too proud to let Miss Snively see how badly she felt.
So she sat silent, miserably twisting her handkerchief
in her hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go back to your session room,&rdquo; said Miss
Snively sharply, who boasted of her summary measures
with her scholars. So Katherine left the room
in disgrace. From that time on there was a marked
antagonism between those two. Miss Snively lost
no chance to make Katherine ridiculous in class,
and, while Katherine had too much respect for
teachers to openly defy her, she &ldquo;took off&rdquo; her affected
manners to delighted audiences outside of
class, and Miss Snively knew it and was powerless
to stop it. But, outside of her skirmishes with Miss
Snively, Katherine&rsquo;s progress through school was a
triumphal march.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>In every school, and Washington High was no
exception, there will be found various elements&mdash;some
good and some bad. Color rushes, which had
given an annual vent to the mysterious feeling of
hostility which always exists between junior and
senior classes, had been abolished. But the feeling
still existed, and manifested itself in various skirmishes.
The year before, when the juniors gave
their annual dance, the seniors carried away the
refreshments. On the night of the senior dance
the lights refused to work, and, of course, the juniors
were at the bottom of the mystery. The principal,
thinking rightly that pranks of this kind reflected
little credit on his school, wrathfully declared
that if any of the seniors attempted to spoil the
juniors&rsquo; party this year there would be trouble. But
there were certain lawless spirits in the senior class
who still thought pranks of that nature funny, and
it was not long before plans were hatching as merrily
as before. It was all very vague, what was
going to be done and who was going to do it, but
it was in the air, and everybody who was up on
school affairs knew there was a storm brewing.</p>
<p>The first definite news came to the Winnebagos
through Katherine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been asked to a select
party,&rdquo; she announced one night up in the Open
Door Lodge, spreading her bony hands out before
the blazing log on the hearth. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something like
the Boston Tea Party,&rdquo; she went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be going to be quite an affair,&rdquo; said Gladys,
who was stirring fudge over the fire. &ldquo;May we inquire
where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, girls,&rdquo; said Katherine, with a serious face,
&ldquo;do you know what&rsquo;s in the wind? The Seniors are
to put a lot of live mice through the windows in
the middle of the Junior dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Seniors?&rdquo; exclaimed Hinpoha and Gladys in
one breath. &ldquo;What Seniors?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Charlie Hughes and Eddie Myers and that
bunch. You know the half dozen that go around
together and call themselves the Clan? Well, those.
They were mixed up in the business last year.&rdquo; Although
Katherine was a newcomer in the school she
was already well versed in its history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you find it out?&rdquo; asked Hinpoha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cora Burton told me.&rdquo; Cora was one of Katherine&rsquo;s
devoted admirers and tried hard to be
chummy with her, although Katherine did not care
for her in the least. &ldquo;Cora&rsquo;s a particular friend of
Charlie Hughes, and she and some other girls are
going along to see the fun. But she couldn&rsquo;t keep it
secret and told me today and asked if I wanted to
go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Katherine, you&rsquo;re not going?&rdquo; said Sahwah
anxiously.</p>
<p>The disgusted expression on Katherine&rsquo;s face was
answer enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better tell some of the teachers?&rdquo;
asked Gladys, pausing in her stirring. &ldquo;I wish Nyoda
were here.&rdquo; Miss Kent had been called out of
town on account of the death of an aunt and would
be away until after the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to, I think,&rdquo; said Hinpoha.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Katherine stood up beside the fireplace, and resting
one elbow on the shelf humped her shoulders
in her favorite attitude and began to speak. &ldquo;Girls,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;this Junior-Senior business is going to be
an awful mess, and the result will be that somebody
will be expelled or not permitted to graduate. Students
are going to take sides in the affair and there
will be no end of hard feelings. I for one don&rsquo;t
care to play the r&ocirc;le of informer. So far we Winnebagos
have kept entirely out of anything of this
kind and wish we could get along without having
any connection with this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the teachers would never tell who told
them,&rdquo; said Hinpoha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The teachers wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Katherine,
&ldquo;but Cora Burton would. And then maybe someone
would say that I had been in the thing to start
with and then grew afraid and told on the others.
You know how those stories grow. Stay out of it
altogether, say I, and avoid publicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s our duty to try and stop
such horrid pranks?&rdquo; asked Hinpoha doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do,&rdquo; said Katherine, &ldquo;and if we were
the only ones who suspected anything it would be
different. But all the teachers know that something
is going to happen and they will be on the lookout.
And the Juniors know it also, and they will be on
their guard. I doubt very much if those mice ever
get into the room, even if we keep silent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Winnebagos, remembering Hinpoha&rsquo;s
sad experience the year before, decided that it was
perhaps better after all to keep out of the affair
altogether.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d see it my way after you&rsquo;d considered
all sides,&rdquo; said Katherine, reaching out her
long fingers and taking three pieces of fudge off
the plate where it was cooling, &ldquo;but that isn&rsquo;t what
I wanted to talk about tonight. It&rsquo;s Cora Burton
that bothers me. She isn&rsquo;t a bad sort of girl, and I
can&rsquo;t see why she should want to get mixed up in
that sort of thing, especially when there&rsquo;s bound to
be trouble later. If she were to be seen with those
boys Friday night it would go hard with her. I
suppose she thinks she&rsquo;s right in the swim being connected
with a prank, because she isn&rsquo;t very popular
otherwise. The other girls that are in it aren&rsquo;t
ladylike and it&rsquo;s not much use getting after them,
but Cora&rsquo;s different, somehow. I wish something
could be done about it.&rdquo; And she crunched a piece
of fudge between her teeth with violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might get up a show that night and each one
bring a friend, and you could invite Cora,&rdquo; suggested
Sahwah. &ldquo;Counter attraction, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suggestion was voted a good one and
promptly acted upon. But Cora declined Katherine&rsquo;s
cordial invitation. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done now?&rdquo;
asked Katherine of the hastily called meeting of
the Winnebagos. &ldquo;Our counter attraction didn&rsquo;t
work.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; said Gladys solemnly, &ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s our
duty to keep Cora away from that business somehow.
If we were smart enough we&rsquo;d find a way.
I don&rsquo;t believe we ought to let the matter drop and
say if she wants to get into trouble let her do it,
it&rsquo;s none of our affair. It <i>is</i> our affair, because we&rsquo;re
pledged to Give Service, and it would be doing Cora
a great service to keep her out of this. If she&rsquo;s weak
and we&rsquo;re strong we must hold her out of water.
You remember what Dr. Harper said at the lecture
about saving people from themselves. Well, I think
we ought to save Cora from herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The phrase, &ldquo;Save Cora from herself,&rdquo; sounded
very fine to the ears of the Winnebagos, and they
decided that Cora must be saved from herself at all
costs. But how?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can manage it,&rdquo; said Katherine, who
had been buried deep in thought all the while the
last discussion was going on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be quite an undertaking,
but the end justifies the means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us,&rdquo; begged the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s this,&rdquo; said Katherine. &ldquo;I shall tell
Cora that I&rsquo;ve changed my mind and want to go
with her Friday night and will meet her on the corner
of her street at eight o&rsquo;clock. When I&rsquo;ve met
her I&rsquo;ll tell her that I left my purse up here and
ask her to come along till I get it. You know she
doesn&rsquo;t live very far from here. Once up here we&rsquo;ll
keep her safely all evening. Oh, I know that holding
people against their will isn&rsquo;t one of the rules of
polite society, but in her case I think we&rsquo;re justified.
She&rsquo;ll thank us for it before very long. And we&rsquo;ll
try to make it pleasant for her. We&rsquo;ll give the show
just as we intended and have a spread and her captivity
won&rsquo;t seem long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>As there seemed no other way out of the difficulty,
Katherine&rsquo;s plan was accepted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s working fine,&rdquo; she confided to the Winnebagos
the next day. &ldquo;Cora was tickled to pieces because
I wanted to go with her. She agreed to meet
me on the corner, as I suggested, and we&rsquo;re both
going to wear green veils so we won&rsquo;t be recognized
so easily. Hoop la!&rdquo; and she did a double shuffle
with her toes turned in down the aisle of the
empty class room where the girls had gathered.</p>
<p>On Friday night the Winnebagos met early in the
House of the Open Door. Mrs. Evans, Gladys&rsquo;
mother, was acting as leader tonight in the absence
of Nyoda. She had been let into the secret about
Cora and under the circumstances thought that their
action was right. Cora lived with an old uncle, who
was stone deaf and didn&rsquo;t care a rap what she did,
so there was no use talking to her folks about it.
Several girl friends of the Winnebagos were present,
all having raptures over the decorations of the
Lodge, and watching with interest the waving curtain
in the corner, behind which Sahwah was making
herself up as a Topsy for their entertainment
later on. Gladys was making sandwiches in another
corner and lamenting because the bread knife
was broken half off, and was accusing Sahwah of
prying bricks apart with it, when stealthy footsteps
sounded on the walk below, together with the noise
of the door being pushed back quietly. Gladys
heard it and started nervously. She was beginning
to feel rather embarrassed at the thought of meeting
Cora Burton, and wondered just how it would come
out, anyway. She wished it were safely over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Katherine and her prisoner seemed a long time
in reaching the foot of the ladder. Did Cora suspect
something, perhaps, and was refusing to
mount? Gladys strained her ears to listen and
thought she heard a smothered giggle from below,
but she could not be sure. The next minute the
lights flashed below and the patent signal knock of
the Sandwiches sounded on the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here come the boys!&rdquo; cried Hinpoha, hastening
to answer the signal with a series of mystic thumps
on the wall with the poker.</p>
<p>Then the Captain&rsquo;s voice sounded at the foot of
the ladder. &ldquo;How many of you are up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five,&rdquo; answered Hinpoha, &ldquo;and three guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Miss Kent there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a show. Want to come
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe, later,&rdquo; answered the Captain.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come down a minute? We&rsquo;ve got
something to show you.&rdquo; And again Gladys thought
she heard a smothered giggle from below stairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>The girls trooped down the ladder, Sahwah running
out with her face blackened and her hair in
tiny pigtails, to see what the excitement was about.
All seven of the Sandwiches stood there with sparkling
eyes and prenaturally solemn faces. On the
floor stood a good-sized box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the box?&rdquo; asked Sahwah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; answered the Captain, trying to
speak indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is too, something,&rdquo; said Sahwah, looking
critically at the express tags fastened to it. &ldquo;Oh,
I know what is is,&rdquo; she cried, suddenly jumping up
and clapping her hands in glee. &ldquo;Your uncle in
Boston has sent you the electric motor he promised
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain tried to look indifferent and failed
utterly. His lips would twitch into a smile in spite
of all he could do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do open it and let us see it,&rdquo; said Hinpoha, and
all the girls crowded closely around.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You may have the honor, Miss Brewster,&rdquo; said
the Captain, bowing formally to Sahwah. The nails
had been drawn and all Sahwah had to do was lift
off the cover of the box, which she did with a great
flourish. The next moment the girls sprang back in
dismay and scattered wildly. The box was full of
live mice, which jumped out and ran in all directions.
Screaming at the tops of their voices the girls fled
toward the ladder and crowded up as fast as they
could go. Sahwah jumped for the swinging rings,
which hung from the ceiling of the barn, and dangled
safely in mid-air, making horrible faces at the
Captain, at which he laughed uproariously. Sahwah
and the Captain were always playing tricks on
each other and this time she had to admit that he
had scored heavily. So the Captain jeered and Sahwah
vowed vengeance and the other Sandwiches
stood around and laughed until their sides ached,
for Sahwah, with blackened face and Topsy braids,
hanging in the rings and sputtering, was the funniest
sight imaginable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joke&rsquo;s over now, boys,&rdquo; said the Captain, when
the mice had run around the barn for several minutes.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had enough of a good thing. Let&rsquo;s
catch them and put them back into the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls above sat around the ladder opening
and watched the proceedings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherever did you get so many mice, boys?&rdquo;
asked Mrs. Evans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found them,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;all boxed
up, just like this, They were right out in the middle
of that field over there. We were on the way
over here and saw the box and looked in. When
we saw what it was we thought we could play a
joke on the girls. So we brought them along. Looks
as though someone had fixed them that way for a
joke. Probably were going to send them by express.
They were in an express box, although it
was not nailed shut.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>The girls began to look at one another significantly.
The same thought came into all their minds
at once. Were not these the mice that were to attend
the Junior party?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The joke is on the Seniors, after all,&rdquo; said Hinpoha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the boys. &ldquo;The
joke is on the Seniors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we tell them?&rdquo; asked Hinpoha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any harm now,&rdquo; said Gladys. &ldquo;The
scheme has collapsed like a pricked balloon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they told the Sandwiches what they knew
about the plot of the Senior boys to interrupt the
Junior party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t such a bad idea to try to play a joke on
you girls after all, was it?&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;Because
if we hadn&rsquo;t done it we wouldn&rsquo;t have nipped
their little scheme in the bud. We&rsquo;ll play lots more
jokes on them, won&rsquo;t we, Slim? Don&rsquo;t you girls
think you ought to invite us up to supper to celebrate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until the last mouse is back in the box,&rdquo; said
Gladys firmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>The boys worked hard to catch them again and
the girls sat above and cheered their efforts, and in
the middle of it in came Katherine and her companion,
swathed in green veils. There was such an
uproar in the barn that Cora never noticed that
Katherine locked the door and put the key in her
pocket. Cora gave a great start at the sight of the
mice, which was not all from fright, and the girls
could not help enjoying the situation. What must
be her thoughts by this time? But Cora, obeying
the natural impulse of women at the sight of mice,
fled up the ladder with Katherine. If she thought
it odd that the barn was full of girls and boys
when she had gained the impression that it was
empty and dark, she made no sign, but stood still
with her veil over her face. With all those horrible
creatures running around the floor downstairs she
made no move to escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take off your things?&rdquo; asked Katherine,
beginning gently to break the news to Cora
that she was to stay for the evening. Without demur
Cora unfastened her coat and slid it off and
then took off her hat and veil. The girls stood as
if turned to stone. The person who stood before
them was not Cora Burton. It was Miss Snively.
<i>It was Miss Snively!</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>She looked around her with a sneering smile and
a snapping light in her eyes. &ldquo;You may think it
was a master stroke on your part to lure me here
and lock me in so I could not join the conspirators
and thus find out who they were,&rdquo; she said with
biting emphasis. &ldquo;But you shall pay dearly for this,
my young friends. I know who you all are&mdash;you
needn&rsquo;t try to hide behinds the others, Gladys Evans&mdash;and
the information I shall be able to give Mr.
Jackson tonight is what he has been trying to find
out for a long time. Katherine Adams, you are
the ringleader of this affair, as we might have expected.
I know all about the plan to put the mice
into the dance hall, and while the boys downstairs
who are getting them ready are not the ones I should
have expected to be doing it, it is just like you to
get strange boys to do it for you, hoping to get
away unsuspected. But it didn&rsquo;t work, I am happy
to say. You are very clever, Miss Adams, but not
clever enough. I overheard you asking Cora Burton
to meet you on the corner this evening. I took
the liberty of being there first. I thought I had
deceived you perfectly, not knowing that you were
bringing me right into the mouse&rsquo;s nest, so to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused for breath and looked around her with
an expression of relish at the consternation visible
on the faces before her. For Katherine was staring
at her with startled, unbelieving eyes; Gladys was
clutching her mother&rsquo;s arm in a frightened manner;
Hinpoha had sunk weakly down on the bearskin
bed, and Sahwah stood with her mouth open and the
perspiration running down her face in black
streaks, and the others were dumb with astonishment.
The boys, not knowing just what was going
on, but guessing that something was the matter,
stood by the ladder opening, silently taking in the
scene. The girls looked helplessly into each other&rsquo;s
eyes. Somebody must speak and explain. They all
looked at Katherine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we aren&rsquo;t mixed up in the House Party at
all, Miss Snively,&rdquo; she said earnestly. &ldquo;We heard
about it, and I found out that Cora Burton was going
to be in it and I tried to make her stay home and
she refused, so we girls decided we would take action
to take her out of it by luring her up here and
keeping her until the thing was over. That&rsquo;s why I
asked Cora to meet me on the corner, and I really
thought you were Cora all the while. You imitated
her squeaky voice to perfection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Katherine was telling her perfectly truthful
story she had a dreadful feeling that it didn&rsquo;t sound
plausible at all. Under Miss Snively&rsquo;s cold eye
nothing seemed real.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likely story!&rdquo; said Miss Snively sneeringly.
&ldquo;And how does it happen that if you wanted to
bring Cora out of temptation you should take her
to the place where the mice were being boxed up
ready to be taken to the party?&rdquo; All the girls
looked so disconcerted. Those dreadful mice did
complicate matters so! They would have given
anything if Nyoda had been there then.</p>
<p>The Captain was beginning to take in the situation.
He came forward frankly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our fault
about the mice,&rdquo; he said, looking Miss Snively
straight in the eye. &ldquo;We found them in a field
near here all boxed up and thought it would be a
good joke on the girls to bring them over here and
let them out. We don&rsquo;t know anything about your
squabbles at Washington High, except what little
the girls here have told us; we&rsquo;re all from Carnegie
Mechanic. And we know the girls didn&rsquo;t have a
hand in it, because they were giving a show here to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>His story was backed up by all the other boys,
and then Mrs. Evans got in a word and declared
that Katherine was telling the whole truth about
Cora, and Miss Snively was forced, however ungraciously,
to admit that she had been mistaken in her
suspicions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;d been a man I&rsquo;d have made her eat her
words,&rdquo; declared Slim wrathfully, after Miss
Snively had departed from the scene.</p>
<p>Mrs. Evans and Gladys, with perfect courtesy,
offered to drive her home in their car, and for the
present oil was poured on the troubled waters.</p>
<p>Katherine sat hunched gloomily before the fire
and held-forth to the Winnebagos. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
whether the joke&rsquo;s on her or on us,&rdquo; she said pessimistically;
&ldquo;but one thing I&rsquo;m sure of, and that is,
that never, never, as long as I live, will I ever again
try to save a girl from herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Winnebagos wearily agreed with her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">AN ADVENTURE IN PHILANTHROPY</span></h2>
<p>Katherine became officially a member of the
Winnebago Camp Fire Group at the first Ceremonial
after the circus, with the Fire Name of Iagoonah,
the Story Maker. The name itself was an
accident and the manner of its bestowing is cherished
in the chronicles of the Winnebagos as one of
the group&rsquo;s best jokes. Just about the time Katherine
was to be installed as a Winnebago, word was
received that the Chief Guardian of the city was
going to be present at the meeting and would take
charge of the Ceremonial. Katherine had chosen
the name, &ldquo;Prairie Dandelion,&rdquo; because she came
from the plains, and because her hair was so fly-away.
During the supper which preceded the Ceremonial
meeting Katherine made such funny speeches
and told such outrageous yarns about her life
in the West that Nyoda said jestingly: &ldquo;Your
name ought to be Iagoo, the Marvellous Story Teller.&rdquo;
And the others began calling her Iagoo in
fun. The Chief Guardian heard them calling her
Iagoo and supposed that was the Camp Fire name
she wished to take. So, when she was receiving
Katherine into the ranks, she said: &ldquo;Your name is
Iagoo, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Katherine, sobered and almost voiceless from the
solemnity of the occasion, mumbled half-inarticulately,
&ldquo;Iagoo? Nah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And before anyone knew what had happened she
had been officially installed as <i>Iagoonah</i>! The joke
was so good that the name stuck, and Katherine
was known to the Winnebago Circle as Iagoonah
to the end of the chapter, although they did consent
to change the interpretation to Story Maker instead
of Story Teller as being more dignified and not so
suggestive.</p>
<p>Katherine was one of the most enthusiastic Camp
Fire Girls that ever lived, and her inspirations led
the girls into more activities and adventures than
they had ever dreamed of before. It was Katherine
who started the Philanthropic Idea. They had been
talking about the different things Camp Fire Girls
could do together for the good of the community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; said Katherine, standing in her favorite
attitude beside the fireplace, with her toes turned in
and her elbow on the shelf, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re
doing all we ought. We&rsquo;re having a royal good
time among ourselves and learning no end of things
to our own advantage, but what are we doing for
others? Nothing, that I can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We gave a Thanksgiving basket to Katie, the
laundress,&rdquo; said Hinpoha, &ldquo;and we collected a barrel
of clothes for the Shimky&rsquo;s when their house
burned down, and we gave a benefit performance to
pay little Jane Goldman&rsquo;s expenses in the hospital,
and we send toys and scrapbooks to the Sunshine
Nursery every Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I earned three dollars and gave it to the
Red Cross,&rdquo; said Sahwah. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you call that
doing something for other people? We haven&rsquo;t
meant to be selfish, I&rsquo;m sure. By the way, Katherine,
your elbow&rsquo;s in the fudge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine shoved the dish away absently and returned
to her subject. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;the
Winnebagos have done a great deal that way, but
it&rsquo;s all been <i>giving</i> something. We haven&rsquo;t <i>done</i>
anything. It&rsquo;s easy enough to pack a basket and
hand it to someone, and collect a lot of old clothes
from people who are anxious to get rid of them
anyway, or pay the bill for somebody else to do
something. But I think we ought to do something
ourselves&mdash;give up our own time and put our own
touch into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean we should do?&rdquo; asked
Gladys, hunting through the dish for a piece of
fudge that had not been demolished by Katherine&rsquo;s
elbow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s the Foreign Settlement,&rdquo; said
Katherine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we could find something to
do there. It&rsquo;s a grand and noble thing to show the
foreigners how to live better.&rdquo; And she launched
into such an eloquent plea in behalf of the poor
overburdened washerwomen who had to neglect
their babies while they went to work that the girls
wiped their eyes and declared it was a cruel world
and things weren&rsquo;t fairly divided, and surely they
must do what they could to lighten the burdens of
their sisters in the Settlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will we do, and when will we do it?&rdquo;
asked Hinpoha, all on fire to get the noble work
started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s Saturday,&rdquo; answered Katherine.
&ldquo;We ought to go out into the Settlement and see
what&rsquo;s to be done. We&rsquo;ll make a survey, sort of,
and then we&rsquo;ll step in and see where we&rsquo;re needed
most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nyoda, appealed to for advice, told them to go
ahead. She liked the idea of their trying to find
out for themselves what needed a helping hand.
She could not go with them to the Settlement on
Saturday morning, but it was all right for them to
go by themselves in daylight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>So, full of a generous desire to help somebody
else, the Winnebagos followed Katherine&rsquo;s lead
toward the Settlement the next day. The Settlement,
as it was called, embraced some three or four
square miles of land adjacent to several large factories.
In it dwelt some few thousand Slovaks,
Poles and Bohemians, packed like sardines in narrow
quarters. The Settlement had its own churches,
stores, schools, theaters, dance halls and amusement
gardens, and looked more like an old world city
than a section of a great American Metropolis, with
its queer houses and signs in every language but
English. The girls wandered up and down the narrow
dirty streets, filled with chickens and children,
and tried to decide what they should do first. They
met the village baker, carrying a washbasket full
of enormous round loaves of rye bread without a
sign of a wrapping. He was going from house to
house, delivering the loaves, and if no one came to
the door he laid the loaf on the doorstep and went
on.</p>
<p>Before one house, which had a small front yard,
between twenty and twenty-five men were lounging
on the steps, on the two benches and against the
fence. &ldquo;What do you suppose all those men are
doing in front of that house?&rdquo; whispered Hinpoha
curiously.</p>
<p>Just then a woman came from the house carrying
in her hand a huge iron frying-pan full of pancakes.
She passed it around and each man took a pancake
in his hand and ate it where he stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re having their dinner!&rdquo; exclaimed Gladys.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a little past noon. That&rsquo;s one way of disposing
of the dishwashing problem. I&rsquo;ll store up
that idea for use the next time it&rsquo;s my turn to cook
supper at a meeting. What a large family that
woman has, though. I wonder if they are all her
husbands?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious no,&rdquo; said Katherine. &ldquo;These people
aren&rsquo;t poly&mdash;poly&mdash;you know what I mean, even if
they are foreigners. Those men are boarders.
Every family has some. Let&rsquo;s go into that big
house over there and ask if there are any babies the
mothers would like to leave with us while they go
washing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They picked their way across the muddy road
toward a large building which opened right on to
the sidewalk. The hall door stood open and they
went in. There were more than a dozen doors leading
from the hall on the first floor. &ldquo;Gracious,
what a number of people live here!&rdquo; said Gladys,
putting her arm through Katherine&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>While they stood there, trying to make up their
minds at which door to knock, one was opened and
a barefooted woman came out, carrying a pan of
dishwater, which she threw out on the sidewalk.
At the same time another door opened and out
came another woman, who stopped short when she
saw the first one, and began to talk in a harsh foreign
tongue. The second woman replied angrily
and the girls could see that they were quarreling.
Before long they were shaking fists in front of each
other&rsquo;s noses and shouting at the tops of their voices.
Doors everywhere flew open and the hall was soon
filled with excited women who took sides with one
or the other and shook fists at each other while the
girls huddled under the stairway, expecting to be set
upon and beaten. The quarrel was waxing more
violent, when the girls spied a door at the end of a
hallway which had been opened to let in some of
the shouting women. As quickly and as quietly as
they could they darted down this passageway and
out of the door which brought them into the back
yard of the place. Terrified, they fled up the street
and stood on the corner, discouraged and irresolute.
Hinpoha was for going home right away. But
Katherine talked her out of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up to the Neighborhood Mission on
the hill and ask them for something to do,&rdquo; suggested
Katherine, when the rest inquired what they
should do next. So they turned their footsteps
toward the white building at the end of the
street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you really want to do something,&rdquo; said the
mission worker to whom they explained their errand,
&ldquo;come down here next Saturday morning and
help take care of the children that are left with us.
Two of the nurses will be away and we will be
short-handed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Winnebagos were charmed with the idea.
&ldquo;Oh, may we each take one home for the day?&rdquo;
begged Katherine, &ldquo;if we promise to bring them
back all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Permission was granted for the next Saturday
and Katherine was jubilant over the good beginning
of their work. &ldquo;I thought it best that we each
take one home and take care of it by ourselves,&rdquo;
she explained. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have such fun telling experiences
and comparing notes afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Promptly at nine o&rsquo;clock the next Saturday morning
the four Winnebagos, Katherine, Gladys, Hinpoha
and Sahwah, presented themselves at the
Neighborhood Mission and drove away ten minutes
later in Gladys&rsquo; automobile, each with a youngster
in tow.</p>
<p>At eight that night there was a lively experience
meeting in the House of the Open Door. &ldquo;Oh,
girls, you never saw such a dirty baby as the one I
had,&rdquo; cried Gladys, with a little shiver of disgust
at the remembrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t have been any worse than the one I
had,&rdquo; broke in Hinpoha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I gave him a bath,&rdquo; said Gladys, with a
satisfied air, &ldquo;and put all new clothes on him, and
he was as sweet as a rose when I took him home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine beat them all,&rdquo; said Katherine, when she
was able to get in a word edgewise. &ldquo;He had a
little fur tail of some kind tied around his neck on
a string. I suppose it was meant for a &lsquo;pacifier,&rsquo;
for he was sucking it all the while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mine had one of those on, too,&rdquo; said
Gladys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did mine,&rdquo; said Hinpoha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must have been a million germs on it,&rdquo;
continued Katherine. &ldquo;I took it off and burned it
up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; said Gladys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; echoed Hinpoha.</p>
<p>After all things were talked over the Winnebagos
decided that they had done pretty good work that
day in cleaning up the dirty babies and unanimously
voted to take them again the next Saturday.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the Neighborhood Mission
the next Saturday morning they were met on the
walk by half a dozen excited women with handkerchiefs
on their heads, who formed a circle around
them, shouting in a foreign tongue and making
fierce gestures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter? What are they saying?&rdquo;
gasped Hinpoha in terror to Katherine, struggling
to pull away from the hand that was clutching her
coat lapel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Katherine, completely
at sea and vainly trying to understand the gibberish
that was being uttered by the brown-skinned
woman dancing up and down before her.</p>
<p>A startled group of workers ran from the Mission
to see what the trouble was, and, forcing themselves
through the circle, drew the frightened girls
inside the fence of the Mission. Then from the
group of women outside there arose a voice in broken
English, demanding angrily: &ldquo;Where is the charm
that hung on the neck of my Stefan? The charm
to keep away the fever and the sore eyes? I give
you my boy to watch, you steal away the charm.
Give it back! Give it back!&rdquo; Here the angry
shouting and gesticulating began again and threatening
hands were waved over the fence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What does she mean?&rdquo; asked Hinpoha. &ldquo;What
charm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t steal any charms,&rdquo; said Katherine indignantly.
&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t take a thing off the babies
except some dirty old rabbits&rsquo; tails that were full of
germs. We burned them up, and a good thing it
was, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the angry shouts of the women gave way
to wails of despair. &ldquo;They burned the rabbits&rsquo;
tails!&rdquo; groaned one woman, who could talk English,
lifting her hands heavenward, &ldquo;the rabbits&rsquo; tails that
the Wonder Woman tied about their necks on Easter
Sunday! Now Stefan will get the fever and the
sore eyes and the teeth will not come through!&rdquo;
And she beat her breast in despair. Then her anger
blazed forth again and she fell to berating the girls
in her own language, and the other women fell in
with her until there was a perfect hubbub. The
workers at the Mission hustled the girls inside the
building and the women finally departed, shaking
fists at the Mission and raging at all the dwellers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was nothing but a dirty old rabbit&rsquo;s tail,&rdquo; declared
Hinpoha tearfully, as the shaken Winnebagos
hastened homeward. &ldquo;I hate foreigners! I
guess we&rsquo;ll never try to do anything for them
again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we will,&rdquo; answered Katherine optimistically;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll learn not to make mistakes in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that donkey over there,&rdquo; said Sahwah.
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he remind you of Sandhelo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Sandhelo,&rdquo; mourned Hinpoha. &ldquo;I
wonder what became of him? We certainly had
fun with him, even if he never would go unless
he heard music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to be characteristic of the donkey tribe
not to want to go,&rdquo; observed Katherine. &ldquo;That
one over there is balking, too. Doesn&rsquo;t the fellow
that&rsquo;s trying to drive him look like a pirate, though?
I wouldn&rsquo;t go for him either, if I were a donkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O look!&rdquo; cried Sahwah in amazement, and they
all stopped still.</p>
<p>A small boy was coming down the street blowing
lustily on a wheezy horn, and as soon as the
donkey heard it he wheeled around, facing the music,
pricked up his ears, uttered a squeal of rapture and
rose up on his hind legs, almost upsetting the queer
little cart to which he was harnessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katherine! I do believe it <i>is</i> Sandhelo,&rdquo; cried
Sahwah, excitedly gripping Katherine&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>The man sprang from the cart and seizing the
donkey by the bit brought him down to earth with
a rough pull that almost jerked his head off, shouting
abuse at him in a foreign tongue. The little
boy, frightened at the uproar, ran away, taking his
music with him. The man got into the cart again
and tried to drive away. The donkey refused to
move. The man began to beat him unmercifully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, girls, we must do something to stop him!&rdquo;
cried Hinpoha, hopping up and down in distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you, stop that!&rdquo; shouted Katherine, running
forward and waving her muff at him threateningly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the law on you!&rdquo; The man either
did not understand, or did not care, for he paid not
the slightest heed to her words. &ldquo;Stop it, stop it,
I say!&rdquo; she commanded, stamping her foot angrily
and wildly wishing she were a man, that she might
beat this bully even as he was beating the poor little
beast.</p>
<p>The man looked at her and grinned derisively.
&ldquo;Who says so?&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say so!&rdquo; said a voice behind Katherine, and
she turned to see the Captain standing beside her.
&ldquo;You stop beating that donkey or I&rsquo;ll punch your
head.&rdquo; He put his fingers to his lips and uttered a
long shrill whistle which the girls recognized as
the call of the Sandwiches, and the next minute the
other boys came running up the side street, Bottomless
Pitt, Monkey, Dan, Peter and Harry, with Slim
trailing along in the rear, puffing violently in his
efforts to keep up with the rest. They surrounded
the cart threateningly and the man sulkily left off
beating the donkey.</p>
<p>Sahwah went forward and stroked the little animal&rsquo;s
head and then she uttered a triumphant cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> Sandhelo!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s part of
his red, white and blue cockade still sticking in his
hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our donkey,&rdquo; cried all the girls and boys,
pressing close around. &ldquo;Where did you get him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not,&rdquo; declared the man angrily. &ldquo;I raise
him myself since he was young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not true,&rdquo; said Sahwah shrewdly. &ldquo;If
you had had him very long you would know how to
make him go. It seems to me that this is the first
time you&rsquo;ve ever tried to drive him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is mine, he is mine,&rdquo; declared the man. &ldquo;I
know how to make him go. He always go for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then make him go,&rdquo; said Sahwah coolly.</p>
<p>The man tried to urge the donkey forward, but
in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, <i>we&rsquo;ll</i> show you how to make him go,&rdquo; said
Sahwah. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that boy with the horn?&rdquo; She
ran up the street a distance and found the boy seated
on a doorstep and bribed him with a few pennies
to let her take the horn. Then, walking along ahead
of Sandhelo she played a half dozen lively notes,
such as had sent him flying round the circus ring.
No sooner had she started than he started at a great
rate. When she stopped he stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sandhelo without mistake,&rdquo; they all cried,
and the last doubt vanished when he came up alongside
of Sahwah and laid his head on her shoulder
the way he always had done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He belongs to us,&rdquo; said the Captain, looking the
man in the eye, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll have to give him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man shifted his gaze. &ldquo;I give him to you for
five dollar,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I pay so much for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;Nobody sold
you a donkey for five dollars and you can&rsquo;t get that
much out of us. Now you either give him to us or
we&rsquo;ll report it to the police.&rdquo; The man protested
loudly, but he was evidently thinking all the while
that a donkey that only went when he heard music
was not such a good bargain after all, even if he
did get it by the simple and inexpensive method of
finding it in his dooryard and tying it up. So, after
growling some more that they were robbing him,
he suffered Sandhelo to be unharnessed from the
cart and led away in triumph in the wake of the
horn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, our charitable enterprise didn&rsquo;t turn out
so badly, after all,&rdquo; said Katherine, when Sandhelo
was once more established in his cozy stall in the
House of the Open Door. &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for
that fuss about the babies we wouldn&rsquo;t have been
on the street in time to see Sandhelo. And if we
hadn&rsquo;t wanted to help those people there wouldn&rsquo;t
have been any fuss. It does really seem that virtue
is its own reward and one good turn deserves another.
Let&rsquo;s do it some more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as usual the others agreed with her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">A SELECT SLEEPING PARTY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, Katherine, what is the matter with
your fingers?&rdquo; asked Gladys curiously, as Katherine
came into the room with all five fingers on her right
hand tied up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Katherine cheerfully, &ldquo;I burned one,
cut one, pounded one with a hammer and slammed
the door on one, and that left only one good one,
so I tied that up, too, for safe-keeping and only
take it out when I want to use it. It&rsquo;s a good thing
I don&rsquo;t need my hand to sing carols with, or I would
be out of the running. Are we all here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All but Veronica,&rdquo; answered Nyoda, &ldquo;and Sahwah&mdash;and
Sahwah will be here presently. By the
way, where is Veronica?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s over at the theater where her uncle is
orchestra director,&rdquo; answered Gladys. &ldquo;She goes
over there almost every Saturday afternoon. I believe
she plays sometimes when one of the regular
violinists is absent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>Veronica, it must be confessed, was a great puzzle
to the Winnebagos. Try as they might, they
could never get her to enter into their work and
fun with any degree of vim. She always sat aloof,
her brooding eyes staring off into space. Not that
they loved her any the less&mdash;they were too genuinely
sorry for her&mdash;but they never seemed to be able to
break down the barrier between them and her. They
constantly stood abashed before her aristocratic
airs. When the friends went together to get ice
cream Veronica had a way of flinging a dollar bill
down on the table and bidding the waitress keep
the change that made the others feel cheap somehow,
although they knew it was useless extravagance.
When a poor woman came to the door one
day, just as she was going out, and asked if she
had any old clothes to give away she promptly took
off her expensive furs and gave them to her.</p>
<p>The girls were mightily impressed by this act
until Nyoda talked it over with them and made
them see that the gift was entirely inappropriate.
So while they admired her to distraction and each
one secretly hoped that Veronica would single her
out as a special friend, they had to admit that as
yet they had not made much headway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Sahwah doesn&rsquo;t come in five minutes, we&rsquo;ll
have to start without her,&rdquo; said Hinpoha, walking
impatiently to the window. &ldquo;Carol practice begins
at two and it&rsquo;s half-past one now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the telephone rang. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sahwah,&rdquo;
reported Hinpoha, upon answering, &ldquo;and she says
she&rsquo;s got a real charity case for us to look into&mdash;some
old woman&mdash;and she&rsquo;s down at Sahwah&rsquo;s
house now and we should all come down. She says
it&rsquo;s the saddest thing she ever heard. What shall
we do, girls, shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Katherine promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about carol practice?&rdquo; asked Gladys.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it make us dreadfully late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just have to be late, then,&rdquo; said Katherine,
jabbing her hatpins in swiftly. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sahwah met them at the door with an unusually
solemn countenance. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a load of bricks to
come, girls,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I knew you would.
Come right upstairs. In here,&rdquo; she said, pausing
before the door of her room. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d better
go in one at a time. You go first, Hinpoha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hinpoha, feeling queer, passed in. The next minute
those outside heard a great shout. &ldquo;Migwan!
My Migwan! When did you come? We thought
you weren&rsquo;t coming for two whole days yet. Sahwah,
you wretch, how could you get us so worked
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others burst in and smothered Migwan in embraces
while Katherine stood looking on curiously,
until Gladys remembered her manners. &ldquo;This is
our Katherine,&rdquo; she said, drawing her forward,
&ldquo;that we have all written you about. Make a speech,
Katherine, to show her how you do it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>And Katherine obligingly complied and Migwan
laughed extravagantly and was soon sitting on the
bed beside her with her arm locked in hers, and
talking to her as if she had known her all her life
instead of only five minutes. That was the effect
Katherine had on everybody.</p>
<p>Then they dragged Migwan out to the House of
the Open Door and introduced her to the Sandwiches,
who were playing basket ball in their half
of the barn. The Sandwiches began to plan a
Christmas barn dance in her honor on the spot, and
nobody thought of carol practice again until it was
too late to go. Migwan had to explain how she
got through with her work at college two days
earlier than she had expected and came home to
surprise them. She went to see Sahwah first and
Sahwah worked the little stratagem which brought
them all down to her house in such a hurry. Each
one insisted upon Migwan&rsquo;s going home with her
to spend the night, but she could not be enticed
away from her own home. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;d want to
stay at home, too, if you hadn&rsquo;t seen your mother
for three months.&rdquo; But she promised to attend a
select sleeping party some night up in the House of
the Open Door, which Sahwah had just &ldquo;germed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a loose shingle on the roof and the snow
comes in a little,&rdquo; said Hinpoha regretfully. &ldquo;It
really ought to be fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the shingle,&rdquo; cried the others.
&ldquo;When did the Winnebagos ever balk at a snowflake
or two on their beds?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>The barn dance was a grand success in spite of
the fact that Slim fell down the ladder in his excitement
and sprained all the portions of his anatomy
that he needed most for dancing, besides demolishing
a frosted cake in the tumble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad you can&rsquo;t dance,&rdquo; said the Captain sympathetically,
when Slim&rsquo;s ankles had been strapped
with plaster and he had been comfortably settled
on a pile of bearskins brought down from the bed
upstairs. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t need to waste your time.
You can be musician and play the banjo while the
rest of us dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t play the banjo,&rdquo; objected Slim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play anyway,&rdquo; commanded the Captain. &ldquo;Here,
I&rsquo;ll teach you a couple of tunes that you can play
with one finger that we can do most of the dances
to.&rdquo; So Slim learned to play the banjo under pressure
and picked banefully away while the rest
whirled about on the floor. Sometimes he got his
tunes or his time so badly mixed that it was impossible
to dance and then the Captain would make
him sing and beat time with a hatchet on the floor.
Finally Nyoda took pity on him and took over the
banjo, producing such lively strains and keeping
the dancers going at such a mad pace that they
sank down breathless one by one, and a series of
loud thumps from Sandhelo&rsquo;s stall told them that he
was also capering to the music and nearly battering
his stall down in the process.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>The boys went home reluctantly at eleven o&rsquo;clock
and the girls climbed the ladder to the joys of the
&ldquo;select sleeping party.&rdquo; This was the first time any
of them had stayed all night in the House of the
Open Door. &ldquo;Covers were laid for nine,&rdquo; as Katherine
wrote in the Count Book. Nyoda had her
camp bed, Sahwah had her pile of bearskins, Gladys
her Indian Bed and Nakwisi her willow bed. Migwan
was invited to share them all and chose the
bearskins. Katherine had brought a couch hammock,
which she declared surpassed them all in
comfort. The rest of the girls played John Kempo
for the privilege of sleeping with Nyoda, and Veronica
got it, and the other two spread their blankets
on mattresses on the floor. The fireplace was filled
with glowing hard coals, which would keep all night,
and the Lodge was as warm as toast, so the snowflakes
which drifted in through the hole in the roof
were never noticed. Of course they talked half the
night, for there was so much to tell Migwan and
so much she had to tell them it seemed they never
would get it all told. But finally the conversation
was punctuated by steadily lengthening yawns, and
then trailed off into silence.</p>
<p>Nyoda was awakened by the touch of a cold hand
on her face. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked, sitting up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s I&mdash;Migwan,&rdquo; said the figure standing beside
her. &ldquo;Do you know where Sahwah is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she in bed with you?&rdquo; asked Nyoda, still in
a low tone of voice, so as not to disturb the other
girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, she isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; whispered Migwan. &ldquo;I woke up
a minute ago and felt around for her and she
wasn&rsquo;t there. I called and asked where she was and
there was no answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nyoda got up and lit a candle, and looked carefully
around the room. All the other girls were
sound asleep in their beds; Sahwah&rsquo;s clothes lay
on a chair, but there was no sign of Sahwah. &ldquo;She
can&rsquo;t be under the bed,&rdquo; said Migwan, &ldquo;because this
bed has no &lsquo;under.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nyoda went to the top of the ladder and called:
&ldquo;Sahwah, are you down there?&rdquo; No answer. All
was dark and silent below. When it was evident
that Sahwah was not in the barn, Nyoda roused all
the sleepers unceremoniously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; they all
cried sleepily. There was a great uproar when
Sahwah&rsquo;s disappearance became known. &ldquo;Where
could she have gone without her clothes?&rdquo; they all
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she was dragged from her bed,
Nyoda?&rdquo; asked Hinpoha anxiously, filled with the
wildest fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Nyoda promptly, suddenly
remembering certain facts in Sahwah&rsquo;s history.
&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s walking in her sleep again.
She always does when she gets excited. She&rsquo;s probably
gotten out of the barn and is wandering around
somewhere and we must find her and bring her in
without delay. This is altogether too cold a night
to be promenading without a coat on.&rdquo; She had
dressed herself fully while she was talking and the
others followed suit with all speed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>The barn door was carefully closed, but the big
inside bolt was unfastened and they knew by that
that Sahwah was outside somewhere. The wind
had swept the snow off the drive and there was not
a footprint to be seen. They spent some time looking
all around the barn and up on the roof and then
concluded that she must have gone down the drive,
because, if she had gone anywhere else, there would
be footprints. The snow in the road had been so
packed down by passing vehicles that a person walking
would leave no trace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can she be?&rdquo; exclaimed Nyoda anxiously
after a fruitless search of some ten minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she could have climbed a tree?&rdquo;
asked Hinpoha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be roosting on a branch?&rdquo; asked Katherine,
and they all had to laugh in spite of their concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you never can tell what Sahwah will do
next,&rdquo; returned Hinpoha, &ldquo;especially in her sleep.
You haven&rsquo;t known her as long as we have. Once
in camp she climbed to the top of the diving tower
and jumped off. So I guess climbing a tree wouldn&rsquo;t
be impossible for her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hark, girls,&rdquo; said Nyoda, bending her head in a
listening attitude. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear music?&rdquo; The
others listened, but could hear nothing. &ldquo;When
that breath of wind came in this direction I thought
I heard it,&rdquo; said Nyoda. &ldquo;There it is, again.&rdquo; This
time they all heard it, faint and far, a soft strain
of music, but what kind of music or whence it
came they could not make out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came with the wind,&rdquo; said Nyoda, &ldquo;so we
must walk against the wind and see if we can find
it.&rdquo; Heading into the wind they walked up the
road. They shivered as they walked and the snow
crunched under their feet. The very moonlight
seemed cold as it touched them and the stars glistened
like splintered icicles. Verily, it was a cold
night to be sleepwalking. The music began to sound
more clearly now, and at a turn in the road they
stopped still in amazement at the sight before their
eyes. There in the road just ahead of them ambled
Sandhelo, and by his side walked Sahwah, dressed
in her troubadour costume, the red cloak flying out
in the breeze. She held her mouth organ to her
lips, and the drawing of her breath in and out of it
was producing the strains of music which the girls
had followed. As they suspected, she was sound
asleep. They hurried forward to waken Sahwah,
and she turned around and faced them. Her eyes
were wide open in the moonlight. A moment she
looked at them and then turned suddenly and swung
herself onto Sandhelo&rsquo;s back. At her touch on his
bridle Sandhelo started and then began running
down the road as fast as he could. Sahwah woke
up, gave one shriek of fright, and then mechanically
dug her knees into his sides and hung on. Sandhelo
did not have his regular harness on, only his bridle,
and she was riding bareback in this strange adventure.
The girls pursued as fast as they could,
shouting at the top of their voices, but of course they
were soon left behind. Far ahead of them in the
moonlit road they saw Sandhelo stop suddenly and
slide his rider over his head into a snowdrift and
then sit down on his haunches beside her like a dog.
Sahwah had emerged from her drift and was shaking
the snow off when the others came up. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter?&rdquo; she asked in a bewildered tone. &ldquo;How
did I get out here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Home first, explanations afterward,&rdquo; said Nyoda,
wrapping her in the bear rug she had brought
with her. And they made Sahwah run every step
of the way back to the Lodge, and swallow quarts
of hot lemonade before they would tell her a single
thing.</p>
<p>Migwan insisted on tying Sahwah&rsquo;s foot to the
post of Nyoda&rsquo;s bed for the rest of the night to insure
her being there in the morning. They had just
gotten quieted down when the ropes of Katherine&rsquo;s
hammock broke and down she came with a resounding
crash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>Morning found them heavy-eyed and full of
yawns, but to all inquirers they stoutly maintained
that the select sleeping party had been the best ever.</p>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">THE CANDLE IN THE WINDOW</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this about singing carols?&rdquo; asked
Migwan. &ldquo;Everywhere I go the talk is all of carols,
carols, carols. And the air is full of &lsquo;God Rest You,
Merry Gentlemen,&rsquo; and similar melodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Music Club League,&rdquo; explained Gladys.
&ldquo;They have revived the old custom of going through
the streets on Christmas Eve with lanterns and
singing carols, and are training the boys and girls
all over the city to sing them. People who are interested
in the work of the Music Club League and
wish to give a gift of money for its support will put
a candle in their windows and we will stop outside
and sing carols for them. Isn&rsquo;t it a pretty idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; said Migwan. &ldquo;I wish I might have
attended the rehearsals so I could go around with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll teach you the carols,&rdquo; said Gladys eagerly,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll explain to Miss Jones and I know she&rsquo;ll let
you be in our group. We&rsquo;ve been given one of the
best districts in the city&mdash;Garfield Avenue, from the
Cathedral to the Park, where all the rich people
live&mdash;and we expect to bring in more money than
any other group. There was great rivalry among
the groups for that district, and Miss Jones tested
and tested us to see which sang the best. I nearly
passed away from surprise when she decided in
favor of our group. Oh, won&rsquo;t it be glorious,
though, stopping before all those fine houses?&rdquo; and
Gladys and Hinpoha, unable to keep still any longer,
got up and began to dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the best part of it, though,&rdquo; said Sahwah.
&ldquo;All the carolers are invited to the Music
League&rsquo;s clubhouse after the singing is over for an
oyster supper and a frolic. And the troupe of
midgets that are playing in the Mansfield Theater
this week are coming and will give a real Punch and
Judy show. Hurrah for the Music Club League!
Hurrah for carols! Hurrah for Christmas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I smell something burning,&rdquo; said Gladys, sniffing
the air suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably something that has been spilled on
the stove,&rdquo; said Katherine serenely. They were all
up at Katherine&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are the carols we are going to sing,&rdquo; said
Gladys, pulling Migwan toward the piano. &ldquo;We
might as well begin at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think Miss Jones will let me do
it?&rdquo; asked Migwan rather doubtfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she will,&rdquo; said Gladys, &ldquo;if we all&mdash;&mdash;Katherine,
there <i>is</i> something burning; it smells like
cloth.&rdquo; And she rushed off unceremoniously to investigate.
The kitchen was full of smoke when she
reached it, proceeding from the ironing board,
where Katherine had left the electric iron standing
without being turned off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to have a leather medal, Katherine,&rdquo;
scolded Hinpoha, switching off the current and setting
the smoking board outside the back door, while
Katherine stood idly by with such a look of pained
surprise on her face that the others went into gales
of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get used to these self-starting, big city
flat-irons, nohow,&rdquo; she drawled mildly in self-defense.
&ldquo;Back where I come from the irons cool off
when you leave them by themselves; here they start
heatin&rsquo; up.&rdquo; Katherine always left off her g&rsquo;s when
she spoke earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katherine, you&rsquo;re hopeless,&rdquo; said Hinpoha with
a sigh, and then she added affectionately, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
why we love you so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Slim outside with his big bob-sled,&rdquo; said
Sahwah, looking out of the window. &ldquo;He promised
to take us all coasting down College Hill this afternoon.
Come on.&rdquo; And they trooped out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>Nyoda took a few round trips on the bob with
the girls, and then, having other things to do, walked
home by herself through the early winter twilight.
A few blocks from her home she saw Veronica
walking along just ahead of her. By her side
walked a young man whom Nyoda recognized as
Alex Tobin, one of the violins in the Temple Theater
Orchestra. He was talking animatedly and earnestly
to her, his white teeth showing often in a
smile beneath his small black moustache. Veronica
was listening eagerly with flushed cheeks and sparkling
eyes. As Nyoda drew near she heard Veronica
say: &ldquo;Oh, a chance to study with him would be
the greatest happiness of my life, but uncle would
never allow it. Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Alex Tobin answered: &ldquo;Does it have to
depend upon your uncle&rsquo;s permission? You have
money in your own right, have you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Veronica noticed that Nyoda was behind
her and turned and spoke and Alex Tobin took
his departure down the cross street. Nyoda looked
after him thoughtfully. She was not fond of Alex
Tobin, although she knew him only very slightly.
He was a young Pole, and quite handsome, but
there was something about his eyes that made a keen
observer dislike him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was at the rehearsal of the Symphony Orchestra
this afternoon,&rdquo; said Veronica, with more animation
than Nyoda had ever seen her display. &ldquo;You
know uncle plays this year and he lets me go along
and listen, that I may benefit from the director&rsquo;s
criticisms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Mr. Tobin play in the Symphony Orchestra,
too?&rdquo; asked Nyoda idly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Veronica. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a wonderful
player; and so kind to me. He takes such an interest
in my playing. He says I will play at concerts
in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it in the least,&rdquo; said Nyoda heartily.
&ldquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t study music to the exclusion
of everything else. You are growing quite thin.
You must stay out of doors more and romp with
the girls. You are missing all the coasting and skating.
&lsquo;Hold on to Health,&rsquo; you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; murmured Veronica absently,
and fell silent, as if she were day-dreaming.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;The Midgets are going to give Punch and Judy
dolls to the carol singers as souvenirs of the occasion,&rdquo;
announced Sahwah, as the Winnebagos assembled
before starting out for the singing on
Christmas Eve. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they be jolly to put up in
our rooms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you know that Jeffry, the famous bird
imitator, was going to be there and give some of his
wonderful bird calls?&rdquo; asked Gladys. &ldquo;Migwan,
you&rsquo;re in luck, being home this week to take in all
the good things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The frolic afterwards is going to be as much
fun as the carol singing,&rdquo; said Hinpoha. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
miss it for anything. And the group that brings in
the most money is going to get a prize,&rdquo; she added,
&ldquo;and have its picture in the Sunday paper. Oh, I
do hope we&rsquo;ll get the most! We must sing our very
best.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a glorious night!&rdquo; they all cried, as
they passed out into the sparkling snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m a carol singer,&rdquo; said Katherine,
and slipped and sat down on her lantern in
her enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you time to walk over to Division Street
with me before we go to Mrs. Salisbury&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked
Gladys, as they went down the street. Mrs. Salisbury
was the lady who had gathered together the
band of carolers to which the Winnebagos belonged,
and they were all to meet at her house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s early yet,&rdquo; said Hinpoha, &ldquo;we ought to have
time. Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they all went with Gladys to deliver a Christmas
parcel to a poor family whom Gladys&rsquo; mother
had taken under her wing. Along the big avenues
through which they walked candles were already
glimmering in windows in friendly invitation to the
coming singers. But there were no candles in the
windows on Division Street. The houses were all
poor little one-story ones, with never a wreath or a
bit of decoration anywhere to show that it was
Christmas. The very lamp-posts burned dimly with
a discouraged air. The girls delivered their bundle
and hastened back up the dark street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop a minute and sing the songs through
once more so Migwan will be sure of them,&rdquo; suggested
Hinpoha. &ldquo;We wanted to before we left the
house, you know, and then we forgot it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they stood still before a bleak, empty looking
house, and sang through all the songs they were to
sing with the group that night on Garfield Avenue.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs3">*    *    *    *    *    *</span></p>
<p>In a bare little room in the shabbiest house on
Division Street a young girl lay in bed day after
day, staring wistfully through the flawed window
pane at the dingy row of houses opposite. She suffered
from hip disease and could not walk, and a
frail little mother cleaned offices to support them
both. Living was cruelly high and there was no
thought of spending anything for Christmas. Martha
dreaded its coming, for she could remember
other days when Christmas had been very different.
Besides, Martha was very lonely. She and her
mother were strangers in town, having come only
six months before, and in all that time not a soul
had come to see them. And because Martha felt so
lonely and so left out of the busy, happy world,
the treatment for which she had come to the city was
doing her no good, and she was not improving at
all. And her mother saw the trouble and sorrowed,
but did not know how to mend the matter. Martha
read in books about the good times girls had together
and longed with all her soul to be part of
such frolics, until it seemed that she could not bear
her loneliness any longer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>Her mother often brought home newspapers from
the offices and in them Martha read about the
groups of boys and girls who were going through
the streets on Christmas Eve singing carols before
the houses where the candles shone in the windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I wish I could hear those carols sung!&rdquo;
she sighed enviously. &ldquo;How wonderful it must be
to be rich and live in a fine house and put a candle
in the window to make the singers stop outside!
And I must always stay in the darkness, and miss
all the fun! Oh, Mother, it isn&rsquo;t fair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sad-eyed little mother cast about in her mind
for some way to amuse her lonely daughter this
dreary Christmas Eve. &ldquo;Let us pretend that we are
rich and great,&rdquo; she said soothingly, &ldquo;and play that
we are putting a lighted candle in our window and
listening to the fine songs of the singers below and
giving them large sums of money for their good
cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good would it do to play it?&rdquo; asked Martha.
&ldquo;We would have to imagine it all. We
haven&rsquo;t even a candle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s play it, anyway,&rdquo; coaxed her mother.
&ldquo;What color candle shall we use tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A red one, with gold designs on it, and a cut
glass candlestick,&rdquo; said Martha, playing the game to
please her mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>So they pretended to set a shining glass candlestick
holding a red and gold candle on the window
sill. &ldquo;Now we must wait awhile in our elegant
parlor for the singers to come,&rdquo; said her mother,
playing the game with spirit.</p>
<p>Then a wonderful thing happened. There was
a sound of footsteps in the creaking snow outside,
footsteps that came to a halt beneath the window,
and then the air was filled with joyous, ringing
melody:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;God rest you, merry gentlemen,</p>
<p class="t">Let nothing you may dismay,</p>
<p class="t0">For Jesus Christ our Savior</p>
<p class="t">Was born this happy day!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Martha and her mother looked at each other with
faces suddenly grown pale, and listened with unbelieving
ears. The song changed as the singers swung
into the measures of a new carol. Surely these
were human voices and not a band of fairies! The
mother crept silently to the window and looked out.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs3">*    *    *    *    *    *</span></p>
<p>When the last note of the songs had died away the
door of the dark house opened and a woman came
out on the steps. &ldquo;Thank you a thousand times
for the singing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in
where my daughter can see you? She won&rsquo;t believe
you are real. She is so sick and lonesome. Please
do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>The Winnebagos started in surprise and looked
at each other somewhat doubtfully. They had not
been aware that they were singing to an audience.
It was getting near the time when they should be
meeting the rest of the group. But this was Christmas
Eve and here was a girl sick and lonesome&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in for a minute,&rdquo; said Gladys and Hinpoha
together. They went in, singing as they went,
and swinging their little lighted lanterns.</p>
<p>Martha&rsquo;s mother lit the one pale little gas flame,
for they had been sitting in the dark before, and
by its light the girls saw the shabby room and the
wan girl lying on the bed. So amazed was Martha
at the sudden appearance of the carolers out of the
night that she forgot to be shy, and before she
knew it she had told them all about the Christmas
Eve game she and her mother had been playing and
how they had set the imaginary candle in the window.
And all of the six months&rsquo; loneliness was in
that little tale, and the girls as they listened became
afflicted with a queer weakness of the eyes that made
them turn their faces away from the light. Over
on the lighted avenue the twinkling candles beckoned
in the gleaming windows of the most beautiful
homes in the city; still farther on the revellers at
the singers&rsquo; party stretched out gay hands to them;
but over it all each one seemed to see the words of
the Fire Law written in letters made of Christmas
stars:</p>
<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;Whose house is bare and dark and cold&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>Mysterious communications and hand signs flew
back and forth between the Winnebagos. Like
magic Gladys and Hinpoha slid out of the door and
like magic they returned a few minutes later, loaded
down with bundles. As the enchanted forests rise
in the fairy tales, so the room was swiftly transformed
and began to blossom in green and red.
Garlands and wreaths hung from the head and the
foot of the bed, and from the gas-jet. Riotous little
bells swung from the doorways; sprigs of holly and
gorgeous poinsettias framed the cheap pictures;
bright candles in cheerful red shades burned on the
table.</p>
<p>Other bundles when opened revealed the &ldquo;makings&rdquo;
of the grandest spread the Winnebagos had
ever had. The Lonesome House was turned into
the Home of Joyous Spirits. Gladys poked up the
fire and made her most tempting Shrimp Wiggle;
Sahwah made the best pan of fudge she had ever
made; Katherine made cocoa, and the rest spread
sandwiches with delicious &ldquo;Wohelo Special&rdquo; chicken
salad, and cut up cake and dished ice cream. Then
there followed such a joyous feast as Martha had
never conceived in her rosiest dreams. Healths
were drunk in cocoa, side-splitting toasts proposed
by the witty toastmistress, Migwan, and songs sung
that made the roof ring. Gladys did her prettiest
dances; Sahwah and Hinpoha did their famous
stunt of the goat that ate the two red shirts right
off the line, and Katherine gave her very funniest
speech&mdash;the one about Wimmen&rsquo;s Rights&mdash;three
times; once voluntarily and twice more by special
request. Martha laughed until she could laugh no
more, and applauded every number enthusiastically,
her usually pale cheeks glowing red with excitement
and her eyes shining like stars. It was late
when they left her, promising to come again soon,
and slipping into her hands various packages containing
gifts of things every girl loves, which Gladys
had hastily bought when she had slipped out to get
the supplies. Among them was a beautifully intricate
puzzle which would keep her interested for
months to come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>Thus it was that the candle which was never lit
guided the feet of the Song Friends to the Dark
House, and gave into their tending yet another fire.
Reports of the gay party at the Music League Club
House came to the Winnebagos from all sides, and
loud expressions of regret that they had missed it.
And the group they were to have sung with brought
in by far the most money, carrying off the prize and
getting its picture in the Sunday paper&mdash;and the
Winnebagos were not in it.</p>
<p>But over on Division Street a wonderful new look
had come into the face of a sad-eyed girl&mdash;a look
of happiness and ambition, and the Winnebagos,
having seen that look, were content.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">A TEMPEST IN A TEAPOT</span></h2>
<p>January closed with its immemorial thaw and
February drew near in a mist of speculation as to
whether it would come in like a lion or a lamb. But
whatever may have been the state of the weather
outside when the new month arrived, the Winnebago
barometer registered a tempest in a teapot.
It was Katherine who was responsible for that particular
barometric activity. That is, it was she who
attached the fuse to the bomb and set the match to
it. All the bomb did was blow up.</p>
<p>The Winnebagos were all over at Katherine&rsquo;s one
Friday afternoon after school, painting a buffalo
robe that was to hang on the wall in the Open Door
Lodge and cover an unsightly board. Veronica was
in one of her rare cheerful moods and played gay
tunes on her violin while the other girls worked.
She was gradually thawing toward the girls, although
she was still very conservative in her friendships.
She was most friendly toward Gladys and
Hinpoha, the two girls who came from the best
family. She was not particularly drawn to merry,
tomboyish Sahwah, because she was not musical,
although they got along. Thus also it was with
Medmangi and Nakwisi. But from the first Katherine
Adams had seemed to rub her the wrong way.
Big, clumsy, awkward Katherine, uncultured and
hopelessly plebeian! She always managed to step
on Veronica&rsquo;s dainty shoes or sit on her cherished
violin or spill cocoa on her dress. And her flyaway
appearance constantly jarred on Veronica&rsquo;s artistic
nature. And that ridiculous, unmusical voice!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>Looking only at these defects, Veronica failed to
appreciate the wonderful magnetism of Katherine&rsquo;s
personality and the unfailing good nature which
made her a boon companion any hour out of the
twenty-four whatever the weather might be. Not
being American-born, Veronica believed firmly in
class distinctions, and to her Katherine was a peasant
and thus an inferior.</p>
<p>However, to the others it seemed that the strangeness
between them and Veronica was wearing away,
and this afternoon they felt closer to her than they
ever had before. She even asked, actually <i>asked</i>,
to be shown how to make &ldquo;slumgullion&rdquo;&mdash;she who
a few months before had scornfully maintained that
cooking was for servants and not for ladies. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
getting there!&rdquo; whispered Gladys to Hinpoha, with
a delighted squeeze. Spirits ran high and before
long everybody felt they must dance or burst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad we haven&rsquo;t Nyoda&rsquo;s old banjo over
here,&rdquo; said Sahwah. &ldquo;Then some of the rest of us
could play and Veronica could dance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go over and get it,&rdquo; said Katherine obligingly.
So she went over to Nyoda&rsquo;s house and got
the banjo, and it was on this errand that her feet
became entangled in the fuse that led to the bomb.
On the doorstep of the house next to Nyoda&rsquo;s, the
house where Veronica dwelt, there sat a snowy
white poodle, fresh from a bath and rivalling in
purity a field of virgin snow. This was Fifi, Veronica&rsquo;s
French poodle, who had come to her as a
Christmas gift, and whose pedigree was considerably
longer than he was. Fifi did not share his
young mistress&rsquo;s ideas as to the unfitness of the peasantry
for association with the high born, and took
a decided fancy to Katherine at first sight. Just
how much he was influenced by half a sugar cookie,
which she held out to him over the fence, it is impossible
to say, but when Katherine turned out of
Nyoda&rsquo;s yard and went up the street, Fifi was at
her heels and refused to be shooed home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come along, then, if you want to,&rdquo; she
said good-naturedly. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re lonesome
with all your folks gone and want some improvin&rsquo;
company, like us. A great hostess I&rsquo;d be, if I turned
down a dog that wanted to come to my At Home
Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The January thaw was still in progress, although
it was the first of February, and the streets were
lakes of slush and mud. Katherine did not mind
mud in the least and stepped cheerfully into the puddles.
Fifi did likewise. By the time they arrived
at the house the comparison of the field of virgin
snow no longer held good. Even Katherine hesitated
about admitting him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>Veronica shrieked when she saw him and did not
share his delight at the unexpected meeting. &ldquo;Oh-oh-oh!&rdquo;
she exclaimed in dismay. &ldquo;He is to go to
the Dog Show tonight. Katie spent all morning
washing and combing him. How did he ever get
out? She must have left the door open. And then
you had to coax him over here, and now look at
him!&rdquo; After a hasty glance the rest decided they
would rather not look at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Katherine, much taken aback, but
still mistress of the situation, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just give him a
nice bath and carry him home and everything will
be all right. Go on dancing, girls, there&rsquo;s the
banjo; Fifi and I will entertain ourselves in the
basement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She set the squirming lump of mud into one of
the wash tubs and let warm water run over him
from a faucet for a few minutes to remove the clods.
Then she set to work in earnest. She hesitated for
some time about what kind of soap to use and finally
decided that dog&rsquo;s hair was the same as camel&rsquo;s
hair; camel&rsquo;s hair was wool; and therefore, according
to the most familiar problem in the whole geometry,
Fifi was all wool and needed Wool Soap. Now
the mud through which Fifi and Katherine had
come was the yellow clayey kind that sticketh closer
than a brother, and Wool Soap was not designed
especially to dissolve it. After three scrubbings and
rinsings Fifi was still a muddy, yellowish gray, and
there was no hope that he would dry into a field of
virgin white as a yellow popcorn kernel bursts into
snowy blossom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>Katherine was discouraged. Then she suddenly
remembered something. &ldquo;Clothes always come out
yellow if you wash them in just soap,&rdquo; she said
triumphantly to herself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the bluing that makes
them white. Fifi needs bluing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But a thorough search of the laundry room failed
to reveal any bluing. &ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; exclaimed Katherine
in vexation. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re out of it. I heard Aunt
Anna mention it this morning. And the stores are
closed this afternoon. What will I do? I don&rsquo;t
dare produce Fifi unless he&rsquo;s all white and nice.&rdquo;
Then it was that Katherine&rsquo;s mighty genius set to
work. A less resourceful person would have been
at a standstill when confronted with such a difficulty;
a genius makes a way when there is none.
In one respect Katherine was an equal of the gods&mdash;what
she wished and did not have she created.
She wished bluing; she must have it; so she calmly
set about making it. Katherine took chemistry and
knew that iodine, applied to starch, will turn it blue.
There was iodine in the house and there was starch.
The pucker vanished from her brow. A far-sighted
person would have foreseen other results from the
mixture beside the chemical action of the iodine on
the starch. But Katherine was not a far-sighted
person. She was a genius. It is said that geniuses,
entirely absorbed in one idea, often forget the most
commonplace fact altogether. Thus it was that
Katherine, filled with the idea that starch turns blue
when mixed with iodine, forgot the original purpose
for which starch was invented. And Katherine had
used flat-iron starch, the kind that gets stiff without
boiling. It turned blue&mdash;a beautiful bright purple
blue&mdash;and she immersed Fifi again and again.
Katherine had to admit that he looked dreadfully
blue when he emerged from the final dip, but
serene in the belief that he would dry pure white
like the clothes did, she rolled him up in a piece of
carpet and set him in a wash basket beside the furnace
to dry. Then she went upstairs and joined the
dancers, announcing with a sigh of relief that Fifi
was clean once more and could come up as soon as
he was dry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>Having been told that Fifi was clean, they naturally
looked for a white dog, and it was not their
fault that they did not recognize the creature that
slunk into their midst in the middle of the revels.
As an Animal from Nowhere he would have taken
the prize over the head of the famous Salmonkey.
His hair was pasted flat to his sides in long, stringy
waves, giving him a queer, corrugated effect. His
head was a dirty, yellowish white, for, in keeping
his eyes out of the blue bath, Katherine had held
his whole head out; and the rest of him was a bright
purplish blue. With his excited red tongue hanging
out in front he looked like a dilapidated remnant of
the American flag. The girls shrieked and fled before
him. Katherine sank weakly down on the
couch and viewed him in consternation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever did you do to him?&rdquo; wailed Veronica,
when informed that this was actually Fifi and not
some freak animal from the Zoo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to blue him to make him nice and silvery
white,&rdquo; explained Katherine ruefully, &ldquo;and
there wasn&rsquo;t any bluing, so I made some with iodine
and starch. I thought he would come out all nice
and fluffy, but instead of that he got&mdash;all&mdash;stiff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Winnebagos burst out into a wild peal of
laughter that made the windows rattle. They were
simply helpless, and laughed until they sank limply
on each other&rsquo;s shoulders. The simplicity of Katherine&rsquo;s
inspirations was nothing short of sublime.</p>
<p>Gaining a measure of control over themselves,
they became aware that Veronica was standing before
them with eyes flashing lightning, in such a
passion as they had never seen any girl display.
Holding her translated pet in her arms, she stamped
her foot and almost hissed at Katherine: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you ever come near me again, you&mdash;you great big
kangaroo from out of the west!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the rest of you are just as bad,&rdquo; she cried,
blazing at them collectively. &ldquo;You think it&rsquo;s funny.
I wish I had never met you, and from this day I am
no more a Camp Fire Girl! I am through with
you!&rdquo; And before they could collect their wits to
reply she had rushed out of the house like a whirlwind.</p>
<p>Completely sobered by the result of her act, Katherine
called herself one name after another and proposed
the most extravagant things in the nature of
penance. She and Nyoda talked it over a long time,
and Nyoda made her see how a habit of doing
things without thinking of the consequences led to
more trouble than deliberately planned evil did, and
she promised faithfully that this was the last rash
act she would ever perform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that Veronica has had time to think it over
and see the funny side, and realize that Fifi is not
hurt, I think you may go over and present your
sincere apologies and make your peace with Veronica,&rdquo;
said Nyoda. And Katherine, humble as the
dust, set forth.</p>
<p>But Veronica would have none of her peace offerings.
She received her apology coldly, and declared
she would never come back into the ranks of
the Winnebagos. Then did Katherine go to Nyoda
and offer to resign from the group if that would
bring Veronica back. &ldquo;She has a better right to
be in it than I,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She was in it first.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>But Nyoda would not consent to that at all. &ldquo;The
whole thing isn&rsquo;t worth such heroic measures,&rdquo; she
declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to Veronica myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she did, with no better results than Katherine.
Veronica would not be appeased, even now that
Fifi was white once more, and had suffered no evil
effects from his bluing. Veronica declared that
Katherine was low class, and not fit for her to associate
with. And she wouldn&rsquo;t forgive the others
for laughing. So Nyoda had to go back and report
her failure to the other girls. And sadly they realized
that their hope of making Veronica into a
Winnebago had evaporated.</p>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">A WINTER HIKE</span></h2>
<p>A long cherished wish of the Winnebagos came
true that winter, for they all got snowshoes for
Christmas. So did the Sandwiches. They brought
them down to the Open Door Lodge to show to the
girls. &ldquo;See what we&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo; said the Captain, with
a slightly superior air as becomes the owner of a
pair of snowshoes in the presence of a mere girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until you see ours,&rdquo; returned the girls merrily,
producing their &ldquo;slush walkers,&rdquo; as Katherine
had dubbed them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t all get them, did you?&rdquo; asked the
Sandwiches, in comical surprise. It was hard for
them to realize that the Winnebagos were as adept
at outdoor sports as they were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We surely did,&rdquo; answered Sahwah. &ldquo;What
good would it do us for some to have them and some
not? We always travel together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain had Hinpoha&rsquo;s in his hand and was
examining them critically. &ldquo;You girls haven&rsquo;t the
right kind of harness on your snowshoes,&rdquo; he said,
with the air of an expert. &ldquo;Straps like yours, that
buckle over the toes and around the heel are &lsquo;tenderfoot&rsquo;
harness. They don&rsquo;t give enough to your
motions and you are likely to freeze your feet. See
our bindings. They are made of lamp wicking and
calfskin thongs. By putting your foot on the shoe
so that your toes come just under the bridle and
binding it fast with the wick, making a half-hitch
on each side and tying a knot at the back of your
shoe you can make a fastening that will hold tightly
as long as you want it too, but will permit you to
free your foot with a single twist in an emergency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you learn all that down at Tech?&rdquo; asked
Hinpoha, with just a touch of sarcasm. It seemed
to her that the Captain was trying to show off his
knowledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t admit that we know as much as they
do about some things,&rdquo; she was saying to herself.
&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t get ahead of us by getting snowshoes,
so now they must claim that theirs are right
and ours are wrong. Ours are more expensive,
that&rsquo;s the whole trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My uncle told me about it,&rdquo; said the Captain
earnestly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been up north and he knows all
about snowshoes. Wait a minute, and I&rsquo;ll show
you what I mean.&rdquo; He bound his snowshoes on
his feet in the approved fashion, and then, by stepping
on one shoe with the other foot, skilfully wriggled
his toe free without injuring the binding. &ldquo;You
couldn&rsquo;t do that if it were buckled,&rdquo; he said simply,
turning to Nyoda for approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Nyoda. &ldquo;We never thought
of that side of it before. Don&rsquo;t you think, girls,
we&rsquo;d better change ours?&rdquo; They all agreed, all
except Hinpoha. For some odd reason she still
fancied that the Captain was crowing over her, and
she was determined to show him that his opinion
meant nothing to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the straps much better,&rdquo; she declared.
&ldquo;And the buckles look so pretty flashing in the sunlight.
Much prettier than your old lamp wicks.
They&rsquo;ll be dirty in no time.&rdquo; And they could not induce
her to change the bindings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Followed days of learning how to run on snowshoes.
It was not so very difficult, after all, not
nearly so hard as the skiing Sahwah had tried the
winter before. There were tumbles, of course, when
they struck unexpected snags, but the snow was
soft and no one was hurt. Hinpoha was glad she
didn&rsquo;t change her smart buckle binding for the
wicking-thong affair of the others, because hers
looked much nicer, and there was no occasion for
getting out of them suddenly. The first day everybody
returned home full of enthusiasm for the new
sport. Sahwah in particular was so anxious for
the morrow to come when she could be at it again,
that she could hardly go to sleep. But when she
woke up in the morning she felt a strange disinclination
to get up. Her limbs ached so fiercely that
she could hardly stand. Her muscles were so
cramped and sore that she was ready to shriek with
the pain. She limped stiffly into the class room half
an hour late, to see Gladys going in just ahead of
her, traveling with a sidewise motion like a crab,
and stumbling as though her feet were made of
wood. Poor Hinpoha never appeared in school at
all that day. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with us?&rdquo; they
groaned, dropping into Nyoda&rsquo;s class room at lunch
hour. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re ruined for life.&rdquo; Nyoda could not
conceal a smile of amusement. &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d get
it,&rdquo; she said, with gentle raillery. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I
advised you not to stay out more than fifteen minutes
the first day. But you were bound to stick to it
all afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you know we&rsquo;d get?&rdquo; they asked
in tones of concern. &ldquo;Are we lamed for
life?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly as bad as that,&rdquo; laughed Nyoda. &ldquo;I
have good hopes of your ultimate recovery. You
have what the French call &lsquo;mal de racquette&rsquo;&mdash;the
snowshoe sickness. You use a different set of
muscles when snowshoeing than you do ordinarily,
and these muscles become very stiff and sore. All
you need is a little limbering oil. Little Sisters of
the Snow, you are learning by experience!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was fully a week before either the Winnebagos
or Sandwiches went snowshoeing again, although
they made excellent excuses. Neither group would
admit to the other that they had become stiff, and
would not limp for worlds when in the sight of the
others, although it nearly killed them to walk naturally.
Nevertheless, they understood each other
perfectly.</p>
<p>In February came a three days&rsquo; snow storm that
covered the earth with a blanket several feet thick,
and a slight thaw followed by a zero snap produced
an excellent crust. The Winnebagos were having a
solemn ceremonial meeting in the Open Door Lodge
when without warning there was a sound of scrambling
up the ladder and the Captain burst in among
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say,&rdquo; he shouted, and then stopped suddenly
as he became aware that the girls were engaged
in singing some kind of a motion song. &ldquo;Excuse
me,&rdquo; he stammered in confusion, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know you were having a pow-wow. I heard you
singing up here and thought you were just having a
good time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What news can you be bringing that made you
burst in on us in such a fashion?&rdquo; said Nyoda
sternly, but with a twinkle in her eye. &ldquo;Speak sir,
the queen commands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain seemed ready to burst with his message
and fired his words like bullets from an automatic
pistol. &ldquo;My Uncle Theodore&rsquo;s here, you
know, the one I said had been up north, and he
knows a dandy place in the country where there
are some log cabins and he wants us all to go down
there on our snowshoes for a winter hike and stay
three days over the Washington&rsquo;s Birthday holiday.
Oh, please, can you girls come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Nyoda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot,&rdquo; went on the Captain, &ldquo;my aunt&rsquo;s
here, too, and she&rsquo;s just as good on snowshoes as
Uncle Theodore is, and she&rsquo;s going along, too, and
will see that you girls don&rsquo;t take cold or anything.
Please say you&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There never was such sport as a winter hike. The
preliminaries were arranged with much reassuring
of parents and relatives; buying of all-wool clothing
and blankets; selecting of cooking utensils and
what the boys elegantly referred to as &ldquo;grub.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Uncle Theodore&rdquo; was a real woodsman, who had
spent most of his life in lumber camps; bluff, hale
and hearty; a man to whom you would be perfectly
willing to entrust your life after the first meeting.
&ldquo;Aunt Clara&rdquo; was a little round dumpling of a
woman, who radiated smiles like sunshine, and declared
the Winnebagos were the handiest girls she
had ever seen. It was their skilful way of packing
supplies that called forth this praise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>Food and blankets were sent down by automobile
a day ahead, so that the hikers would have to carry
nothing but their cameras and notebooks. The
morning of Washington&rsquo;s Birthday found them all
assembled on the station platform, for they were to
go by cars to a certain town down state and from
there to strike across the open country on their snowshoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with the torpedo?&rdquo;
shouted the Captain, as Slim appeared carrying a
strange looking package.</p>
<p>Slim smiled mysteriously. &ldquo;Shoot rabbits,&rdquo; he
replied evasively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a torpedo,&rdquo; said quick-witted Sahwah,
after one look at the package. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a thermos bottle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A chorus of derision went up. &ldquo;Better Baby has
to have his bottle!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, Slim! Are you afraid
you&rsquo;ll starve before we get our dinner?&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
in it, Slim, let&rsquo;s see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slim turned fiery red and shot a dark look at
Sahwah.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot chocolate, I know,&rdquo; continued his red-cheeked
tormentor. &ldquo;Slim has to have a dose every
hour or he feels faint.&rdquo; Sahwah had long ago discovered
Slim&rsquo;s pet weakness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Katherine?&rdquo; said somebody suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, isn&rsquo;t she here?&rdquo; said Nyoda, counting over
the group. &ldquo;I thought I saw her here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t come yet,&rdquo; declared Hinpoha and
Gladys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope she hasn&rsquo;t had an absent-minded fit
and forgotten this is Washington&rsquo;s Birthday,&rdquo; said
Sahwah, clasping her hands in distress.</p>
<p>Uncle Teddy pulled out his watch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late
to go and look for her,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just five minutes
until train time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Consternation reigned in the group. The Captain
gallantly offered to miss the train and hunt her
up, but the others would not hear of it. Hasty
telephoning to her house brought the news that
Katherine had left half an hour ago for the station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she&rsquo;ll be here,&rdquo; said Nyoda, eyeing the
clock nervously. &ldquo;If she doesn&rsquo;t make it she&rsquo;ll have
to miss it, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; There were times when she
would have liked to shake Katherine for her unbusiness-like
ways.</p>
<p>But eight twenty-five came and no Katherine.
The long train pulled in and Uncle Teddy swung
them all aboard, and with a great cheering and waving
of snowshoes they were off. Other passengers
looked with interest at the lively group that occupied
one whole end of the car, singing, laughing,
shouting nonsense at one another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Time for the Better Baby to have his bottle!&rdquo;
said the Bottomless Pitt, gaining possession of the
thermos bottle. He unscrewed the lid and held it
to Slim&rsquo;s lips, making him drink willy-nilly. It
was hot chocolate, as Sahwah had guessed. Slim
choked and sputtered and had to be patted on the
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do behave, children,&rdquo; said Nyoda, as the fun
threatened to block the aisle, &ldquo;that magazine man
can&rsquo;t get through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man stood in the midst of the scufflers, patiently
trying to cry his wares above the din.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buy a maggyzine,&rdquo; he chanted. &ldquo;All the latest
maggyzines!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Good ones for the ladies,</p>
<p class="t">Bad ones for the gents;</p>
<p class="t0">All the latest maggyzines</p>
<p class="t">For fifteen cents!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Amused, they stopped talking to listen to his ridiculous
singsong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buy a maggyzine, lady?&rdquo; he said, holding one
out to Nyoda. On the last sentence his voice
cracked in three directions and leaped up the scale a
full octave, so the word &ldquo;lady&rdquo; was uttered in a high
falsetto squeak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Katherine!&rdquo; exclaimed Nyoda, seizing the
magazine seller by the arm in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At yer service, mum,&rdquo; replied that worthy, with
a low bow.</p>
<p>Then, amid the hubbub that ensued she calmly
proceeded to remove the fuzzy little black mustache
that had adorned her upper lip, took off the
fur cap that had covered her hair and threw back
the long ulster that covered her from neck to heels,
and stood smiling wickedly at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katherine, you awful, awful, wonderful, wonderful
girl, how did you manage to do it?&rdquo; gasped
Gladys, breathless with astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when did you get on the train?&rdquo; cried Hinpoha
in the same breath. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t get on with
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got into the wrong street car this morning,&rdquo; replied
Katherine, producing her glasses from her
sweater pocket and polishing them on the end of her
muffler, &ldquo;and got carried east instead of west. When
I found it out there wasn&rsquo;t time to come back to the
Union Station, so I went on out to the Lakeside
Station and go on the train there. I had planned
to be waiting for you on the step when we got into
the Union, but on the way out I met a magazine seller
and had an inspiration. I bribed him to let me
take his cap and books and coat for ten minutes.
The mustache I had with me. I thought it might
be useful in case I should be called up to perform a
&lsquo;stunt&rsquo; at Lonesome Creek. The rest you already
know, as they say in the novels.&rdquo; She tossed the
borrowed plumage into an empty seat and settled
herself beside Slim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; she said quizzically, looking at the
boys, &ldquo;what was it I heard you declaring a while
ago, that no girl could masquerade as a boy and
really fool a boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh, you didn&rsquo;t really fool us,&rdquo; said
Slim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; jeered Katherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;d have found you out before long,&rdquo;
said the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you would and maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
said Katherine. &ldquo;The only thing I noticed you
doing was looking with envy at my little mustache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain blushed furiously and the rest
shouted with laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, Nyoda knew me first,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;and that shows that girls are smarter than boys.
I can just see us being fooled by one of you dressed
as a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet I could do it,&rdquo; said the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe <i>you</i> could, Cicero,&rdquo; said Hinpoha sweetly.
Relations between her and the Captain were somewhat
strained these days, but how it began or what
it was all about, no one could tell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>The Captain turned angrily at the taunting use
of his name. He knew it was meant to imply that
he was &ldquo;Cissy&rdquo; enough to pass off for a girl. &ldquo;So
you think I&rsquo;m a Cissy, do you?&rdquo; he said hotly. If
Hinpoha had been a boy there would have been a
scuffle right there, but as it was he was helpless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them how you trailed the fox up in Ontario,
father,&rdquo; interrupted Aunt Clara hastily, and
Uncle Teddy began a thrilling tale of adventure in
the backwoods that held them spellbound until they
reached their station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the long white trail!&rdquo; cried Uncle
Teddy cheerily, when all snowshoes were adjusted
to their owners&rsquo; satisfaction. &ldquo;Nine o&rsquo;clock and
all&rsquo;s well! Catertown and dinner at twelve o&rsquo;clock,
ten miles due south as the crow flies! Here, Captain,
you be the first pathfinder. Here is a map of
the way we are to take. You may be leader until
you get us off the track, and then we&rsquo;ll let one of
the girls try her hand. Forward, march!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whole new worlds lie before the hiker on snowshoes.
All the ugliness in Nature is concealed by
the soft white mantle of snow, like a scratched and
stained old table covered with a spotless cloth, and
everything is glistening and wonderful and beautiful.
The snowshoes are seven league boots in very
truth. On them you go right over stumps and fences
and hummocks and stones and little hollows. You
do not need to keep to the road or to the beaten
track. Dame Frost, like Sir Walter Raleigh, has
spread her mantle over the unpleasant places and
over it you may pass in safety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we now?&rdquo; asked the Bottomless Pitt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Casey&rsquo;s Woods,&rdquo; replied the Captain, referring
to his map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Sahwah, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you remember how
we wanted to come here to a picnic once in the summer,
but we couldn&rsquo;t go into the woods at all, because
the mosquitoes were just terrible? Why didn&rsquo;t
we ever think of holding a picnic in the winter?
There are no ants to crawl into your shoes and no
spiders to get into your cocoa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no poison ivy,&rdquo; said Gladys. &ldquo;Why, winter
is the very best time to hold a picnic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they made up a hiking song to the tune of
&ldquo;Marching Through Georgia,&rdquo; and sang it until the
woods echoed:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hurrah, hurrah, said the possum to the &rsquo;coon,</p>
<p class="t0">Hurrah, hurrah, what makes you come so soon?</p>
<p class="t0">We started in the morning, and we&rsquo;ll get there before noon,</p>
<p class="t0">As we go hiking on our snowshoes!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Aunt Clara look just like a Teddy Bear
in that brown fur coat?&rdquo; whispered Gladys to Sahwah.
Aunt Clara was nearly as broad as she was
long, and, wrapped in furs as she was, seemed
rounder yet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; cried Uncle Teddy, as the company came
out on the edge of a deep ravine. &ldquo;Oh, I say, Captain,
what&rsquo;s this? It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me I included
this in my order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much confused, the Captain spread his road map
on a log and set the compass on it, trying to find out
where he had gone wrong. &ldquo;Shucks,&rdquo; he said disgustedly,
after a moment&rsquo;s study. &ldquo;We should have
gone at right angles to that hundred-foot pine tree
instead of in a line with it. Everybody back up&mdash;I
mean, right about face. Shucks!&rdquo; And he handed
the map and the compass to Sahwah with as good
grace as he could and took the end of the line, as
became an officer who had been reduced to the
ranks.</p>
<p>Sahwah led them back to the pine tree and in the
right direction from it, as indicated on the map,
and they soon came to the bridge which spanned the
gorge a mile below the spot where the Captain had
reached it. Detour and all they reached Catertown
at twelve o&rsquo;clock, where their ravenous appetites
worked fearful havoc with the good dinner set before
them. Uncle Teddy insisted upon having
Slim&rsquo;s thermos bottle filled with milk, to guard
against his getting faint on the way, although Slim
blushed and protested. Ten more miles to make in
the afternoon. But to these practised hikers the
distance before and behind them seemed nothing
wonderful and they declared the going was so good
on snowshoes that they could keep on forever. Sahwah
followed the map accurately, and brought them
out at the right crossroads at the end of five miles,
where she relinquished her office as pathfinder to
Bottomless Pitt, who was next in line. It had been
decided en route that five miles should be the length
of any leader&rsquo;s service.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Honorable discharge,&rdquo; said Uncle Teddy, patting
Sahwah on the head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager there aren&rsquo;t
many girls who could have done that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of us could,&rdquo; answered Sahwah, eager to
sing the praises of the group as a whole.</p>
<p>The Captain said nothing. He felt that he had
disgraced the Sandwiches by letting a girl get ahead
of him. It did not help him any to note that Hinpoha
was looking at him and evidently thinking the
same thing. The Captain was very sore at heart.
He liked and admired Hinpoha more than any of
the other Winnebagos, and they had always been
the best of friends until suddenly, for some reason
which he could not explain, she had turned against
him. And she had done the one thing to him that
he could never forgive. She had called him &ldquo;Cicero.&rdquo;
All was over between them. Winter hikes
weren&rsquo;t such a lot of fun after all, he told himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, look at the rabbit,&rdquo; shouted Pitt, pointing
out an inquisitive bunny that sat upon his haunches
under a tree, &ldquo;to see the parade go by.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt him, don&rsquo;t hurt him,&rdquo; cried Sahwah,
dancing up and down and trying to focus her camera
on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s hurting him?&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;We
haven&rsquo;t anything to hurt him with, unless Slim steps
on him.&rdquo; Sahwah clicked her camera and at the
click Br&rsquo;er Bunny vanished into space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what kind of tracks he made,&rdquo; said
Sahwah, and they all willingly detoured a trifle to
examine the footprints in the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some others beside his,&rdquo; said Bottomless
Pitt. &ldquo;What kind of an animal is that, Uncle
Teddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Teddy examined the tracks and nodded his
head with a satisfied air. &ldquo;You boys ought to know
those tracks,&rdquo; he said provokingly. &ldquo;What kind of
scouts are you, anyway? Here, Captain, quit your
scowling like a thundercloud and tell us what animal
has been taking a walk. I certainly have taught
you enough about woodcraft to know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain looked at the tracks closely. &ldquo;I
think it&rsquo;s a &rsquo;coon,&rdquo; he said finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think so!&rdquo; scoffed Uncle Teddy. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
know so? Pitt, what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a &rsquo;coon to me,&rdquo; answered Pitt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you say, Redbird?&rdquo; asked Uncle
Teddy, pulling Sahwah&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s where you boys have us beaten,&rdquo; said
Sahwah frankly. &ldquo;We never have had a chance
to learn animal tracks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a &rsquo;coon,&rdquo; said the Captain, his spirits
rising with the chance to crow over the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, if you&rsquo;re sure of it, we&rsquo;ll follow the
trail awhile and see where he is,&rdquo; said Uncle Teddy.
&ldquo;But you always want to be sure of what you see,
after you&rsquo;ve learned it once. A good woodsman
always fixes a thing in his mind so he&rsquo;ll know it the
next time he sees it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a &rsquo;coon,&rdquo; repeated the Captain.
&ldquo;May we follow the trail awhile?&rdquo; Eagerly they
trotted along beside the footprints in the snow, impatient
to have a sight of the animal. This was a
new sport to the Winnebagos and they were greatly
excited about it. The Captain had forgotten his
low spirits and was in the lead now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, the fellow that spies him first ought to be
pathfinder for the rest of the way,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does a &rsquo;coon look like?&rdquo; panted Sahwah,
trying to keep up with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a short, thick, striped tail,&rdquo; said the
Captain, &ldquo;and a&mdash;&mdash; Oh, goodness gracious! Oh,
Methuselah&rsquo;s great grandmother!&rdquo; For just then
the wind began to blow strongly from the direction
in which they were going, carrying with it an unmistakable
odor. With one accord they took to
their heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Uncle Teddy,&rdquo; said the Captain, furious at
himself, &ldquo;you knew what it was all the while! Why
didn&rsquo;t you tell us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Uncle Teddy dryly, &ldquo;you were so
blooming sure it was a &rsquo;coon that I couldn&rsquo;t contradict
you very well without being impolite. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
nothing like being dead sure,&rsquo; I says to myself.
And I knew you would never be satisfied until you
had found out for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain, permanently abashed, retired to the
rear of the line and ventured no more opinions about
anything they saw, and took not the slightest interest
when Hinpoha discovered a rare little moosewood
maple and identified it by its beautiful green
bark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last lap!&rdquo; shouted Pitt, consulting the map for
the hundred and fortieth time. &ldquo;Turn east by the
twin oaks and approach the camp from the rear!
Company, forward march!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are the cabins now,&rdquo; cried the Monkey,
throwing his cap into the air. &ldquo;Maybe I won&rsquo;t sit
down and hold my feet up, though!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you won&rsquo;t jump around and get some
firewood, though!&rdquo; remarked Uncle Teddy. &ldquo;End
of the hike, messmates,&rdquo; he shouted, executing a
droll dance on his snowshoes and waving his long
arms like windmills. &ldquo;All together, now, three
cheers and a tiger for the end of the hike!&rdquo; And
they gave them with a will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>The place where they were to spend that night
and the next was an abandoned sugar camp. It had
once been a fine grove of trees, but so many had
been killed by the boring worms that it was no
longer profitable. Two cabins remained standing
and were used on and off by hunters during the
season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h-h, ours is a real log cabin,&rdquo; cried Sahwah,
dancing around in ecstasy when quarters had been
assigned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lots nicer than the old board shack
the boys are going to have. I&rsquo;ll feel just like Abraham
Lincoln to-night, only so much more elegant,
because Abraham Lincoln had to split his own rails,
and we can sit at ease and let the boys tote our
wood for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;where are the beds?&rdquo; cried Hinpoha, in
perplexity, as they went inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, <i>those</i>,&rdquo; said Aunt Clara, pointing to some
bin-like things ranged in a double tier along one
wall. &ldquo;Those are our bunks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bunks!&rdquo; echoed the girls in rather a dismayed
tone. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d have to sleep in bunks.
We expected camp beds, at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re quite comfortable,&rdquo; said Aunt Clara reassuringly,
&ldquo;when they&rsquo;re filled with clean straw.
Our blankets are in that big box and we&rsquo;d better
get our beds made the first thing, so we can roll into
them as soon as we get tired.&rdquo; She bustled around,
smoothing out the straw in the bunks with a practised
hand and showing the girls how to fold their
blankets to the best advantage. &ldquo;Be sure you have
just as much under you as over you,&rdquo; she advised
them again and again. &ldquo;Camping in winter is a
very different proposition from sleeping out in summer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>Now that the girls had gotten used to the idea
of the bunks, they began to think it was a jolly good
lark to sleep in them. &ldquo;If bunks it must be, bunks
it is,&rdquo; said Katherine, in a lugubrious tone that sent
them all into gales of laughter, &ldquo;but I never thought
I&rsquo;d live to see the day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me for the upper berth,&rdquo; said Sahwah, standing
on a table to accomplish the spreading of her blankets.
It was not long before they were all singing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re bunking tonight on the side of the wall,</p>
<p class="t">Give us a ladder, please,</p>
<p class="t0">We&rsquo;ve slept in many beds, both hard and soft,</p>
<p class="t">But never in bunks like these!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Bunking tonight,</p>
<p class="t0">Bunking tonight,</p>
<p class="t0">Bunking on the side of the wall!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And they raised such a din with the chorus that
the boys came streaming over to see what the fun
was about and to inquire casually if supper wasn&rsquo;t
nearly ready.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness, no,&rdquo; answered Nyoda; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve just
got our beds made. Go overpower Slim, if you are
hungry, and take his bottle away from him. By
the way, which cabin is to be honored by the smell
of the cooking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The log cabin is the largest,&rdquo; said Uncle Teddy,
&ldquo;and it has both the fireplace and the little stove.
The other is just a sleeping cabin. I guess the honor
is yours. All aboard for the dining car! Where&rsquo;s
that canned soup? Bring in the wood, boys, and
make a cooking fire in the stove. You know what
a cooking fire is, I suppose. Everybody get to work.
Too many cooks can&rsquo;t spoil this broth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They flew around, getting in each other&rsquo;s way
dreadfully, but under Uncle Teddy&rsquo;s and Aunt
Clara&rsquo;s able management they did contrive to accomplish
the things they were trying to do, and in
less than no time the supper was steaming on the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I won&rsquo;t do anything to that soup and that
creamed fish!&rdquo; sighed Slim, his face beaming at the
sight of the banquet spread before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it won&rsquo;t do anything to him!&rdquo; said Katherine
in an aside to Sahwah. &ldquo;I got a whole teaspoonful
of Hinpoha&rsquo;s old talcum powder in the
cream sauce before I discovered it wasn&rsquo;t flour, and
then it was too late to take it out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Sahwah giggled back, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so hot
you can&rsquo;t taste it, and it won&rsquo;t last long enough to
get cold. Your secret is safe in our stomachs!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>The paper plates made a grand glare in the fireplace
after supper was over and in its light Katherine
and Slim gave a Punch and Judy show until Slim
showed symptoms of bursting from want of breath,
whereupon the play came to an end and it was discovered
that Bottomless Pitt had fallen asleep in a
corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hide his shoes!&rdquo; suggested the Monkey, and
promptly took them off and tied them by strings to
a tack in the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s enchant him altogether,&rdquo; said the gifted
Katherine, and fastened the little mustache to his
lip. Then they stuck his head full of paper curls
and powdered his face with flour. The effect when
he woke up was all they had hoped for. They had
set a small wall mirror on the floor beside him, so
he got the full benefit of his altered appearance on
his first glance around. Uttering a startled yell, he
sprang to his feet, looking wildly around. Brought
to himself by the laughter on all sides, he shook his
fist fiercely at Slim and the Captain, declaring that
he would make the fellow who did that eat soap.
As Katherine was the &ldquo;fellow&rdquo; in question this only
increased the merriment at his expense. Slim leaned
against the wall so helpless from laughter that he
didn&rsquo;t even resist when Pitt climbed on his shoulders
to haul down his shoes, but went on chuckling violently
until he sagged to one side and down came
both boys in a heap, shoes, tack and all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you boys would go home,&rdquo; said Katherine
primly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re altogether too rough for us little
girls to play with. I think it&rsquo;s horrid and nasty to
play tricks on people when they&rsquo;re asleep.&rdquo; From
her gently shocked and disapproving expression you
never would have guessed that she was the one who
had started it all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on home, fellows, we&rsquo;re invited out,&rdquo; said
Uncle Teddy, with a pretended injured air. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
time we little gentlemen were in the hay&mdash;I mean
the straw. Come on, Pitt, never mind looking for
the tack; Mother will find it when she gets up in
her stocking feet to see if she locked the door!&rdquo; With
which shot he retired in haste through the doorway
and over to the other cabin, and just in time, for
Aunt Clara sent a snowball flying after him that
fell short by a bare inch.</p>
<p>Then she closed and barred the door, fixed the
fire with hardwood which would last the rest of the
night, plastered adhesive strips over the various blisters
which the Winnebago feet had acquired on the
long march, and tucked them all in warmly with a
motherly pat and a goodnight kiss. After a twenty-mile
walk in the open air a hard plank would be a
comfortable resting place, and the straw filled and
blanket padded bunks were far from the hard plank
class. For the first time in the history of Winnebago
sleeping parties there was strictly &ldquo;nothing doing&rdquo;
after they were tucked in. Most of them fell
asleep during the process of tucking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>Thus it was that when the first thump came at
the door nobody stirred. A second thump followed
like a blow from a battering ram. Aunt Clara sat
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; she called. No answer save a
series of blows and thumps that threatened to break
the door down. The rest were awake by this time,
trembling in their beds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theodore, is that you?&rdquo; shrieked Aunt Clara
above the noise. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Again
came a shower of blows, as if somebody were trying
to force their way in with an axe. This time
the bars gave way and the door swung inward.
There was a loud bellowing, roaring sound, which
seemed to their startled ears like a deep-throated
whistle, and into the cabin there walked a cow.
The girls shrieked and disappeared under the bed-clothes,
for to their excited fancy she looked like
a wild animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoo, get out!&rdquo; shouted Aunt Clara, throwing
her slipper with neat aim into the cow&rsquo;s face. Bossy
looked reproachfully at her and walked farther into
the cabin, standing close beside the row of bunks.</p>
<p>Katherine raised her head from the blanket to
see what was going on and looked right into the
open mouth of the creature as it stood over her.
&ldquo;Murder! It&rsquo;s going to eat me up!&rdquo; she shrieked,
diving under the covers with a prolonged howl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>By this time Aunt Clara had found the whistle
with which she always summoned her husband when
she needed him and blew a long, shrill blast. A few
minutes later Uncle Teddy appeared at the door,
with a string of startled boys running out of their
cabin behind him, and at a word of command from
him, accompanied by several emphatic pokes and
proddings, Mrs. Bossy meekly turned and walked
out through the doorway, which was considerably
the worse for her entrance. She had probably
strayed from the nearest farmhouse and was suffering
from the intense cold. Attracted by the light
streaming from the little window of the cabin she
had come to find shelter, and when nobody answered
her first gentle knocks with her horns, she
had taken matters into her own hands and become
housebreaker. She was stabled in a lean-to shelter
for the rest of the night and made comfortable with
straw and a blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it funny how all the suffering critters come
to our hospitable door for shelter?&rdquo; said Katherine
at the breakfast table. &ldquo;Just like Sandhelo. He
came of his own accord, also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must know that we keep the Fire Law,&rdquo;
answered Hinpoha. &ldquo;&lsquo;Whose house is bare and
dark and cold, whose house is cold, this is his own&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it strange that she came to our door, and
not to the boys&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Gladys. &ldquo;They had a light
shining, too, but her footprints show that she came
past their door to stop at ours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because she was a lady,&rdquo; replied Uncle
Teddy, helping himself to his fifth slice of fried
bacon, &ldquo;and no lady would come bustling into a
gentleman&rsquo;s apartment like that. Hurry up and get
your chores done, you housekeepers and wood-gatherers,
and let&rsquo;s go out and make a snow man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make a totem-pole,&rdquo; suggested Katherine,
when they were all out playing in the snow. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
lots more epic than making a snow man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean a &lsquo;snowtem pole,&rsquo;&rdquo; observed Uncle
Teddy.</p>
<p>So they set to work and made a marvellous totem-pole,
higher than the cabin, with figures carved into
its sides such as were never on land or sea. Then
Uncle Teddy and the boys, who had done less carving
on their sections and consequently were finished
first, set up a barber pole on the other side of the
doorway, containing the stripes with a crimson of
their own concocting, which was a secret, but which
involved several trips to the kitchen and the food
supply box. All this time the Captain had never
spoken one word to Hinpoha. Whenever he would
have relented under the spell of the jolly larks they
were having, something whispered to him, &ldquo;She
called me Cicero! I won&rsquo;t stand that from anyone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s ripe for a trifling sprint of five miles this
afternoon?&rdquo; asked Uncle Teddy at the dinner table,
taking three scones at once from the plate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I! I! I!&rdquo; cried a chorus of voices, and a dozen
hands waved frantically above the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any special place in mind?&rdquo; asked
Aunt Clara, pretending not to see Uncle Teddy stealing
yet another buttered scone from her plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Uncle Teddy, &ldquo;I happen to know
that there&rsquo;s a real sugar camp in action somewhere
about here, and I think five miles covers it, there
and back. It might not be the worst idea in the
world to look in and see how they are getting on.
I dare say most of these folks here have never seen
maple syrup outside of a can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sigh of delight ran around the table. &ldquo;Hurry
up, everybody, and put everything you have left
into your mouths, so I can collect the plates,&rdquo; said
Sahwah, impatient to start at once.</p>
<p>But when the time came to start Hinpoha had
developed such a dizzy headache that going along
was out of the question. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing serious,&rdquo;
she stoutly maintained, in reply to anxious inquiries.
&ldquo;Too much noise, that&rsquo;s all. We might call it
&lsquo;Mal de racket&rsquo;!&rdquo; She would not hear of any of
them staying at home with her, however, although
Aunt Clara and Nyoda both insisted. &ldquo;Go on, all
of you,&rdquo; she begged, pressing her hand to her throbbing
temples. &ldquo;It would make it so much worse if
I thought I had kept you away from the fun. All I
want is to lie down quietly. I&rsquo;ll be perfectly all right
here. If I feel better soon I&rsquo;ll follow your tracks
and either catch up with you or meet you there and
come back home with you. Please go.&rdquo; And so
insistent was she that they went without her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be sure you lock the door carefully,&rdquo; called
Aunt Clara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be sure you put out a sign, NO COWS
ADMITTED,&rdquo; said Sahwah. And laughing they
set out, leaving her tucked in her bunk. With the
cessation of the noise that had almost lifted the roof
of the cabin during the dinner hour, the headache
gradually disappeared, and in an hour Hinpoha was
herself again. Swiftly buckling on her snowshoes
she ran out into the stinging air, which seemed like
a cool hand laid on her forehead.</p>
<p>She found the trail of the others easily, for
the crust was slightly dented in by every step. The
way led through a thick strip of woods. Hinpoha
noticed that there were many tracks of animals here
and wished with all her heart that she knew what
they were. &ldquo;It would be such a grand thing to say
to the folks at home, &lsquo;I followed the trail of a
&rsquo;coon,&rsquo; and be sure it was a &rsquo;coon,&rdquo; she said to herself,
and then laughed aloud at the ridiculous mistake
of the Captain. Then she stood still in delight,
for just before her a dark, furry body was slipping
along over the snow. &ldquo;I believe that really is one,&rdquo;
she said to herself joyfully. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t catch him, of
course, but maybe he&rsquo;ll run up a tree&mdash;people always
talk about &rsquo;coons being treed&mdash;and then I can see
what he looks like.&rdquo; And she sped after the little
animal, who took alarm at her first step and disappeared
between the trunks of the trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>Hinpoha looked for him for a while and then
realized it was a hopeless search and with a sigh
turned to resume her own way through the woods.
Then she stopped in dismay. The broad trail she
had been following so easily had vanished from the
earth! The only marks on the white ground were
those of her own snowshoes. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she
said, coming to herself with a shake, &ldquo;I got off the
trail when I followed that &rsquo;coon. I&rsquo;ll follow my
own tracks back.&rdquo; But her own tracks led her round
and round in a circle, in and out among the tree
trunks, and did not end up in what she sought. It
took her some minutes to realize that she was actually
lost in the woods. Then, of course, the first
thing she did was to go into a panic, and run wildly
back and forth. &ldquo;Come, this will never do,&rdquo; she
told herself severely, standing still. &ldquo;I must stop
and think before I do anything else. Let me see,
what was it Migwan did the time she was lost up
in the Maine woods? She sat down on the ground
and wrote poetry, and waited until we came and
found her! I can&rsquo;t write poetry, that&rsquo;s out of the
question, and I can&rsquo;t sit on the ground, either, it&rsquo;s
too cold. I&rsquo;ll have to stand up and wait.&rdquo; But that
proved a dreary amusement. It was getting bitterly
cold, and a strong wind whistled through the
bare branches till it made her flesh creep. To make
things worse, an early twilight was setting in and
the light was rapidly fading. To keep from taking
cold she walked up and down bravely among the
trees, growing more terrified every minute. She
tried to sing, to call, to shout, to make her voice
carry across the snow, but it was lost in the moaning
of the wind. Her feet grew numb with the cold
and she stamped them vigorously to start up the
blood. The crust broke through, and down she
went through several feet of snow to her waist. She
braced herself with her hands and tried to draw her
feet out, but they went through also and she floundered
with her face in the icy snowflakes. Then
with a growing sense of horror she realized what
had happened. The ends of her snowshoes had become
firmly wedged under the roots of a tree, and
she was unable to pull them out. And her feet,
tightly bound to the snowshoes by the pretty straps
and buckles, were trapped. She struggled furiously,
and only sank deeper in the snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p class="tb">As the &ldquo;syrup party,&rdquo; as they called themselves,
were just ready to cool off the bit of boiled sap
that had been given them to taste, the Captain suddenly
sprang to his feet and smote his forehead.
&ldquo;Daggers and dirks!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I left my
sweater hanging right in front of the fire when we
came away&mdash;you remember it got all wet in the
snowball fight this morning&mdash;and I bet it&rsquo;s scorched
to cinders by this time. Do you folks mind if I
go back to the cabin in a hurry? I got that sweater
for Christmas and I hate to lose it so soon. I&rsquo;m
all right, uncle, I can find the way, even if it is
getting dark. Don&rsquo;t hurry yourselves. Give my
share of the syrup to Slim. He&rsquo;s getting thin.&rdquo;
And adjusting his snowshoes with a skilled &ldquo;jiffy
twist,&rdquo; he was off down the trail.</p>
<p>Now the Captain, although he had been mistaken
about the tracks the day before, was nevertheless
an observant lad, and when he came to the place
where Hinpoha had left the trail, he noticed the
marks going off in another direction and stood still
and looked at them. He knew that they most likely
belonged to Hinpoha, and he knew also that she had
not arrived at the sugar camp and he had not met
her on the trail coming home, so, putting two and
two together, he decided that she must be in the
woods somewhere. A mean little instinct whispered
to him to go on his way and let her be wherever she
was, and get a good fright until the rest found her;
then his better nature rose to the top and he decided
to hunt her up and show her the trail to meet
the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Glory, she certainly did mess up the trail some,&rdquo;
he said to himself, as he followed the marks which
wandered up and down and doubled back on themselves
and crisscrossed everywhere. It was slow
going, for the darkness was hiding the footprints
and he had to bend down to the ground to see them
clearly. He almost stepped on her at last when he
did find her. She was numb from the cold and
very nearly asleep and he thought she was dead.
The imprisoned snowshoes held her down and he
could not pull her out of the snow at first. Finally
he suspected what had happened and dug down in
and loosened the buckles. It took a good deal of
working after she was freed to get life back into
the numb feet and ankles, but it was accomplished
at last and Hinpoha was ready to walk home.</p>
<p>Then a moment of embarrassment fell between
them. Hinpoha flushed and looked uncomfortable.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I called you Cicero,&rdquo; she said, with a
sneeze between every word. &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t a Cissy at
all. You&rsquo;re a hero!&rdquo; And then for no reason at
all, except that the afternoon&rsquo;s strenuous adventure
had unstrung her nerves, she burst into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the Captain, entirely light-hearted
again, and holding up the little bucket he had carried
away from the sugar camp, &ldquo;cry into the pail.
Evaporate the water. Save the salt. It&rsquo;s worth
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Hinpoha giggled foolishly and dried her
tears and raced back to the cabin as fast as she
could go, to stave off pneumonia on her arrival with
hot blankets and steaming drinks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>is</i> a hero,&rdquo; she murmured dreamily to Gladys,
who hovered around her like an anxious grandmother,
after the others were satisfied that she was
all right, and had set to work getting supper; &ldquo;he
never once said, &lsquo;I told you so&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">HINPOHA&rsquo;S ROMANCE</span></h2>
<p>An indistinct murmur floated down from the
Winnebago room of the Open Door Lodge, punctuated
by little squeals and exclamations. The firelight
shown on four tense faces, and four pairs of
eyes were riveted on the two figures in the center
of the group who were engaged in a very singular
occupation. Balanced between two stiffly outstretched
and quivering right forefingers hung a
key, and suspended from it by a string was a black-covered
book, supposed to be set apart from all
secular uses. In a breathless undertone Hinpoha&mdash;for
she was the owner of one of the aforesaid fingers&mdash;was
chanting a passage of scripture designed
for a widely different application. A strained hush
was followed by another outbreak of exclamations.
&ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s turning! It began to turn the minute she
said, &lsquo;Turn, my beloved.&rsquo; What letter did it turn
on, &rsquo;Poha?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;D,&rdquo; replied Hinpoha, in a solemn whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D,&rdquo; repeated the chorus, &ldquo;what does that stand
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daniel,&rdquo; supplied Sahwah promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name&rsquo;s going to be Daniel,&rdquo; chanted the
chorus. &ldquo;Now try for the last name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the mystic rite was performed. At &ldquo;I&rdquo; the
Bible trembled with a premonitory movement. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
turning!&rdquo; whispered the chorus in an awed tone.
&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t either; it&rsquo;s still again.&rdquo; After that one
tremor the soothsaying volume remained bafflingly
motionless through the recitation of the mysteries
which accompanied the letter J. K likewise began
uneventfully. But no sooner had Hinpoha uttered
the fateful words, &ldquo;Turn, my beloved,&rdquo; when with a
suddenness that scared them half out of their wits
the key turned sharply in the supporting fingers,
twisted itself free and fell to the floor with an
emphatic bang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s K,&rdquo; cried Hinpoha, covering her face with
her hands. &ldquo;What names begin with K?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;King,&rdquo; said Gladys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knight,&rdquo; suggested Katherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the noble names,&rdquo; said Nakwisi dreamily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Daniel King,&rdquo; said Sahwah experimentally,
whereupon Hinpoha hid her face in the bearskin
rug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You try it, Katherine,&rdquo; said Gladys. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold
the key with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m afraid to try it,&rdquo; said Katherine, hanging
back and looking uncomfortable. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,
anyway; nobody&rsquo;d have me for a gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It always tells the truth,&rdquo; said the blushing Hinpoha.
&ldquo;You know Miss Vining, Clara Morrison&rsquo;s
old maid aunt? Well, Clara persuaded her to try
it and it wouldn&rsquo;t turn for her at all, and they went
through the alphabet three times in succession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a skeptical expression Katherine suffered
herself to be placed on the box covered with an old
piece of tapestry displaying a threadbare figure of
the three fates, which was the seat of those engaged
in the mysteries. &ldquo;My beloved is mine, and
I am his,&rdquo; she recited jerkily, keeping her eyes glued
to the key. &ldquo;He feedeth upon a row of lilies&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s &lsquo;He feedeth upon the lilies,&rsquo; just &lsquo;the lilies&rsquo;;
the &lsquo;row&rsquo; part comes later,&rdquo; interrupted Gladys in a
sharp whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He feedeth upon the lilies, just the lilies, the
row part&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; repeated Katherine dutifully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; it&rsquo;s all wrong,&rdquo; said Gladys impatiently.
&ldquo;Begin again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My beloved is mine&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katherine! Oh-h-h-h Katherine! Are you up
there?&rdquo; the voice of Slim suddenly called from below.</p>
<p>The girls all started guiltily and fell into confusion.
&ldquo;Sh! Hide the Bible, quick!&rdquo; cried Hinpoha
in a sibilant whisper, darting forward and snatching
it from Katherine&rsquo;s hand and concealing it under
the bear rug.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you girls doing up there?&rdquo; came from
below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; floated down the illuminating reply
from above.</p>
<p>If Nyoda had not been so completely engrossed in
her private affairs just at this time she would have
noticed the subtle undercurrent which seemed to
have caught hold of the toes of the entire feminine
half of the senior class at Washington High. It
was not the Winnebagos only. In fact, they had
caught it from the others. Every class has its epidemic,
be it tonsillitis, friendship link bracelets or
Knox hats. This year it was fortune telling.
Where the mystic rite described above originated
nobody could exactly tell, but in less than a week
every girl in the class had been initiated into the
secret, and was busy discovering what her future
initials were to be. The performance was always
carried on behind locked doors or in places otherwise
secure from adult eyes, and was often interrupted
right at the most exciting point by approaching
footsteps, but questions as to how the innocent
maids had been improving the shining hour invariably
brought out the reply, &ldquo;Oh, we weren&rsquo;t doing
<i>anything</i>&mdash;much.&rdquo; Missing keys and books of family
worship led to embarrassing questions once in a
while, but somehow the situation was always bridged
over and parents and teachers never really did find
out what the fascinating something was that drew
their young friends off into groups by themselves
from which they emerged to day dream instead of
getting their lessons and to make mysterious references
to certain initials.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>The book and key oracle reigned supreme for
several weeks and then gave place to the horoscope.
For ten cents in stamps a certain seer dwelling in a
remote town in Oregon offered to &ldquo;cast&rdquo; the principal
events, past, present and future, in the lives of
all young lady correspondents. It was not long before
intimate heads were bent over scraps of paper
comparing horoscopes. Hinpoha&rsquo;s was acknowledged
by all to be the gem of the collection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a brilliant future before you,&rdquo; it read.
&ldquo;You will have a romantic love affair and will marry
your first lover. He is a great scholar who will
afterwards become president. You will meet him
when you are very young.&rdquo; Then followed a dozen
lines more of brilliant prophecy. The special friends
of Hinpoha, who had been allowed to peep at her
fortune, Gladys, Sahwah, Katherine, Nakwisi and
Medmangi, and one or two others, who had fore-gathered
ostensibly to rehearse a school song, sat
back and regarded their fortunate friend with awe.
None of their fortunes had contained anything so
dazzling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be the President&rsquo;s wife!&rdquo; murmured
Sahwah. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t forget us, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; declared Hinpoha magnanimously,
stealing a sly glance into the mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t be ashamed of me when I&rsquo;m
married and come calling at the White House,&rdquo; said
Katherine, rather dolefully. &ldquo;All I drew was a
farmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only got an automobile manufacturer,&rdquo; echoed
Gladys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what comes of having red hair,&rdquo; said
Sahwah enviously. &ldquo;Her fortune said he would be
drawn to her by her beautiful tresses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Hinpoha was preparing for bed that night
she stood fully an hour before the mirror and regarded
her shining curls. Up until now she had
never paid much attention to them except when the
boys called her redhead and pretended to light
matches on her head, and then she wished with all
her heart, like the little girl in the song, that she
had been &ldquo;born a blonde.&rdquo; Now for the first time
her hair appeared beautiful to her. She arranged
the curls this way and that, piling them on her head
and letting them fall over her white shoulders. And
all night she dreamed of standing up in a carriage
and bowing graciously to cheering multitudes and
clasping in her arms the forms of her girlhood
friends who were among the crowd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>The horoscopes had their day and gave way to
something still more exciting, something so secret
that at first it could not be mentioned in words, but
was only alluded to by mysterious references.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marjorie King went,&rdquo; said Gladys to Hinpoha,
&ldquo;and she won&rsquo;t tell a thing she found out, but she
says it was the grandest thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s worth fifty cents,&rdquo; said Sahwah
skeptically. &ldquo;Anyhow, I haven&rsquo;t that much to
spend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t ever dare tell anybody, they say, not
a soul,&rdquo; reported Gladys later. &ldquo;If you do, the nice
things won&rsquo;t happen and the bad ones surely will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the Seventh Daughter of a Seventh
Daughter,&rdquo; observed Hinpoha in an awe-stricken
tone. &ldquo;Did you ever hear of anything so wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are <i>you</i>?&rdquo; asked Sahwah anxiously, of Hinpoha.</p>
<p>This last question was entirely unrelated to the
preceding statement concerning the Seventh Daughter
of a Seventh Daughter. It was part of the cryptic
jargon employed in the discussion of a momentous
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Hinpoha uncertainly.
&ldquo;Would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do,&rdquo; begged Gladys, &ldquo;and then if you find
out something nice we&rsquo;ll go in after you. Oh, I
forgot, you can&rsquo;t tell us anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would your mother mind if you did?&rdquo; asked
Hinpoha, hesitating on the brink.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She really wouldn&rsquo;t mind, but she&rsquo;d think it
awfully silly,&rdquo; answered Gladys, &ldquo;so I don&rsquo;t believe
I&rsquo;ll tell her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might find out the whole name,&rdquo; said Sahwah,
looking at Hinpoha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just when it&rsquo;s going to happen,&rdquo; finished
Gladys.</p>
<p>Hinpoha suddenly made up her mind. &ldquo;I believe
I will,&rdquo; she said, looking at Sahwah.</p>
<p>Where Hinpoha&rsquo;s thoughts were the next day in
school nobody knew, but they were certainly not on
her lessons. She failed signally in every class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what were the initials of the great poet,
Longfellow?&rdquo; cooed Miss Snively, in her honeydrip
voice.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;initials&rdquo; penetrated Hinpoha&rsquo;s wandering
mind. &ldquo;D. K.,&rdquo; she murmured dreamily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; purred Miss Snively. &ldquo;Can it be that
I have been misinformed?&rdquo; But today sarcasm was
lost on Hinpoha.</p>
<p>After school was out a select group, half of which
seemed to be hanging back and being coaxed on
by the other half, walked ten blocks to an unfamiliar
car line and transferred to a cross-town line.
There was a much more direct route to their destination,
but that laid them open to the risk of meeting
friends and relatives who might casually inquire
whither they were bound. Just wherein lay the
crime in what they were doing, no one could have
told, nor why it should be kept such a dark secret,
but singly and collectively they would have died
rather than reveal the nature of the latest epidemic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>By devious ways they reached the end of their
journey and stood irresolute on the sidewalk before
a house which bore a plate on the door announcing
that that same roof sheltered the object of their desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we all go in together?&rdquo; whispered Gladys.
There was no need of whispering, for no one was
within earshot, but with one accord they lowered
their voices. They went up the steps and held another
consultation. &ldquo;You ring the bell,&rdquo; said Gladys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you ring it,&rdquo; said Hinpoha. Thus encouraged,
Hinpoha pushed the button, the door swung
inward and they passed through. An hour later
they stood on the corner again, waiting for the car
to take them home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she say anything about&mdash;about&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; inquired
Gladys.</p>
<p>Hinpoha clapped her hand over her mouth and
made inarticulate sounds beneath it, but her eyes
were sparkling, as they never sparkled before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; gasped Gladys; &ldquo;I forgot you
mustn&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you give us a hint?&rdquo; begged Sahwah, who
had gone along for moral support.</p>
<p>Hinpoha shook her head and retained her finger
on her lips to stop any leaks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it couldn&rsquo;t have been any nicer than mine,&rdquo;
said Gladys, with an air of satisfaction. &ldquo;Mine was
just splendid. Maybe yours wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;favorable?&rdquo;
she added, stricken with a sudden doubt as to the
superiority of Hinpoha&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was, too!&rdquo; declared Hinpoha. &ldquo;If you took
all the nice things out of ten fortunes it wouldn&rsquo;t
be as nice as mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladys looked unconvinced. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll wait a
year or two until they begin to come true, and then
we&rsquo;ll see which had the nicer,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>Hinpoha laughed outright. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to wait
a year or two before mine comes true,&rdquo; she announced
triumphantly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming true in the
very near future. I&rsquo;m going to meet a light-haired
young man and he&rsquo;s going to admire my hair and
fall in love with me, so there! Is yours any nicer
than that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you told,&rdquo; cried Sahwah. &ldquo;Now it won&rsquo;t
come true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hinpoha stopped in dismay. &ldquo;Well, Gladys made
me,&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;If she hadn&rsquo;t said hers was better&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
The car came along then and a truce was
patched up. Such a delicate subject could not be
discussed openly in the street-car, even to quarrel
about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>But if Hinpoha spent a bad night mourning because
she had broken the spell of her good fortune,
the next day sent all doubts flying to the
winds. The week before the bald-headed teacher of
the literature class had occasioned a bad break in
the routine of the course by inconsiderately dying of
pneumonia in the middle of the term. For several
days thereafter the grief of the class was tempered
by the fact that there were no recitations. But on
the day after Gladys and Hinpoha, with Sahwah
and Katherine as chaperones, had visited the Seventh
Daughter of a Seventh Daughter, an announcement
appeared on the session room blackboard to the
effect that literature recitations would be resumed
that morning. As they filed into the literature class
room they were greeted by the sight of the new
teacher standing beside the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys and girls,&rdquo; said the principal, who was
doing the honors, &ldquo;this is Mr. David Knoblock, who
will have charge of this class in the future.&rdquo; And
he hurried out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David Knoblock!&rdquo; whispered the wit of the class
to his neighbor. &ldquo;Knoblock, No Block, see?&rdquo; And
a titter ran through the class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David Knoblock!&rdquo; said Katherine to herself.
&ldquo;He looks as though his name might be Percy Pimpernell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;David Knoblock!&rdquo; repeated Hinpoha to herself,
and sat mute before the workings of fate. David
Knoblock. D. K. The Car of Destiny had stopped
before her door and from it had alighted the fair-haired
stranger!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>Standing before the class in the glory of his yellow
hair, pale, sprouting mustache, blue eyes and
pink cheeks, Mr. Knoblock seemed to them a composite
of Adonis, Paris and Apollo Belvidere, whose
mythical charms had been impressed upon them by
the late lamented instructor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has the class been reading, Miss&mdash;ah&mdash;Miss
Katherine?&rdquo; he inquired, consulting the class
roll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tennyson, Mr. Knoblock,&rdquo; answered Katherine
briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Professor</i> Knoblock, if you please,&rdquo; he corrected
gently. &ldquo;Ah, yes; Tennyson.&rdquo; And turning the
pages of his book with a manicured finger, he found
the place and began to read aloud, glancing up at
one or another of his girl pupils from time to time.
More and more often that glance rested on Hinpoha,
for with the sun shining through the window
on her hair she was the most vivid spot of color in
the room. Finally he did not take his eyes away
at all, and, looking her straight in the face, he read
in sentimental tones:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Queen of the rosebud garden of girls,</p>
<p class="t">Come hither, the dances are done,</p>
<p class="t0">In gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls,</p>
<p class="t">Queen, lily and rose, in one;</p>
<p class="t0">Shine out, little head, sunning over with curls,</p>
<p class="t">To the flowers, and be their sun.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>In the blaze of that glance Hinpoha&rsquo;s romantic
heart melted like a lump of wax. The room swam
in a rose-colored mist. The great thing that she
had read about in books had happened to her; she
was in love! It was not long before the whole
school knew about the affair. Whenever there was
a sentimental passage in the book Professor Knoblock
looked at Hinpoha and at her alone. He often
detained her a moment after class to inquire if that
last paragraph had been entirely clear to her; he
thought she had looked not quite satisfied with his
explanation. As he roomed in the next street to
her home he generally met her on the corner in the
morning and walked to school with her. Certain
sour-dispositioned damsels in the class, who had
made eyes at the new Lochinvar in vain, made sneering
remarks about a girl who had so few boy friends
in the class that she had to ogle a teacher; others
sighed enviously when they looked at her woman&rsquo;s
crown of glory and realized their handicap; the
Winnebagos regarded the whole thing as the workings
of fate, pure and simple, for was it not even as
the Seventh Daughter of a Seventh Daughter had
predicted?</p>
<p>As for Hinpoha herself, she was too transported
to care what anyone else thought about it. She was
surrounded by a rarified atmosphere and the voices
of earth troubled her not. Just now she sat blushing
deeply and crushing in her hand a note which
had appeared mysteriously between the pages of
her <i>Selections from the Standard English Poets</i>.
It was written in Mr. Knoblock&rsquo;s slanting backhand,
and read:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;<span class="sc">My Dear Miss Bradford</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never have I seen such glorious hair as yours.
I cannot take my eyes from it while you are in the
room, and it haunts me by night. May I ask a great
favor of you&mdash;that you grant me one lock, one small
lock, as a keepsake? I fear you will be too modest
to make this gift in person, and all I ask is that you
slip it into the dictionary on my desk.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The signature was a long ornamental K, with a
running vine entwined about its upright stroke.</p>
<p>Hinpoha scarcely raised her eyes above the level
of her book during the whole recitation. She sat
nervously toying with a long perfect curl that hung
down over her shoulder. Toward the close of the
recitation period she came out of her abstraction
and touched the boy in front of her on the shoulder.
&ldquo;Lend me your penknife,&rdquo; she whispered in answer
to his look of inquiry. The Senior Literature Class
occupied the last hour of the day, and as Mr. Knoblock
had no session room, the passing of the class
left the room empty. On this day Mr. Knoblock
left the room with the class on the stroke of the
bell, and the boys and girls, trooping out in a hurry
to get home, did not notice that Hinpoha loitered.
She glanced around nervously, satisfied herself that
she was unobserved and then darted toward the dictionary
on Mr. Knoblock&rsquo;s desk. Going out of the
door a minute later she ran violently into Katherine,
who had carried out her inkwell instead of her English
book, and was coming back to replace it. Katherine
looked at her curiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Hinpoha in a flustered tone,
&ldquo;I really didn&rsquo;t see you. I was thinking about something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hinpoha looked at Mr. Knoblock with an air of
expectancy when she entered the room the next
morning, looking for some sign of gratitude for the
lock of hair, but he said, &ldquo;Good morning, Miss
Bradford,&rdquo; in his usual tone and made no further
remarks. But before the hour was over he took
occasion to borrow her book for a moment, and
directly after he returned it a note fell from its pages
into her lap. With starry eyes she unfolded it and
read:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O Morning Star that smilest in the blue,</p>
<p class="t0">O star, my morning dream hath proven true,</p>
<p class="t0">Smile sweetly, thou! my love hath smiled on me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The lines were from &ldquo;Gareth and Lynette.&rdquo; The
universe turned into song. It was getting altogether
too much for Hinpoha to hold and that afternoon
before the fire in the Open Door Lodge she revealed
the progress of her romance to the other Winnebagos.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you really give him a lock of your hair?&rdquo;
asked Gladys.</p>
<p>Hinpoha nodded. &ldquo;Just a tiny curl. It doesn&rsquo;t
show much at all where I cut it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Collecting locks of hair doesn&rsquo;t mean so terribly
much,&rdquo; said Katherine dryly. &ldquo;I read about a
boy once who begged a lock of hair from every girl
he met and then had his sister embroider a sofa
cushion with them. And another one used them for
paint brushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but this is&mdash;different,&rdquo; said Hinpoha with
lofty pity. It had just dawned on her that Katherine
was jealous. The same miracle that had dropped
the scales from her eyes and revealed to her the
fact that she was beautiful had also made her realize
that Katherine was hopelessly plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then the verse he wrote afterward,&rdquo; said
Gladys, hastening to uphold Hinpoha. &ldquo;That proves
he is in earnest. And, anyway, it must be true.
Didn&rsquo;t all the fortunes say he was fair and his initials
were D. K., and he was a great scholar, and
would be president, and he would fall in love with
Hinpoha&rsquo;s hair?&rdquo; And Katherine had to admit that
whatsoever was written in the stars was written.</p>
<p>It mattered little to any of them, Hinpoha least
of all, that Professor Knoblock had thus far said
nothing openly upon the subject to Hinpoha.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t his bashfulness adorable?&rdquo; cooed Gladys.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too shy to express himself face to face with
her; he puts all his&mdash;his passion into writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t those notes be lovely to read over together
when you&rsquo;re old?&rdquo; said Sahwah, also stricken
with a sentimental fit. But at the mere mention of
such a thing Hinpoha fled with burning cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Red,&rdquo; said a cheerful voice in her ear, as
she went dreaming down the street one day. &ldquo;Where
have you been keeping yourself for the last few
weeks? You haven&rsquo;t been down in the gym once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Captain,&rdquo; she said sweetly. (How young
he was, she was thinking. How hopelessly kiddish
beside the manly form of Professor Knoblock!)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you must have your tin ear on today,&rdquo; remarked
the Captain jovially. &ldquo;I had to call you
three times before you answered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; said Hinpoha, and blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have been an awful hard think,&rdquo; remarked
the Captain, stooping to throw a stone at a cat.
(He&rsquo;s nothing but a kid, thought Hinpoha for the
second time.)</p>
<p>It was on this occasion that the Captain, happily
believing all was well between himself and Hinpoha,
invited her to go to the Senior dance at Washington
High with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, Captain,&rdquo; she said kindly,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m going with&mdash;someone else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked the Captain blankly. The &ldquo;bid&rdquo;
for that party had cost the Captain just a dollar and
a half, as he was not a member of the class, and he
had made the investment for the sake of going with
Hinpoha and no one else. So he repeated in a startled
tone, &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, someone,&rdquo; answered Hinpoha tantalizingly,
and with that he had to be content. To herself she
was saying, &ldquo;How foolish it would be to promise
to go with the Captain and then not be able to accept
when&mdash;when <i>he</i> asks me.&rdquo; For word had gone
round the school that all the faculty were going to
honor the Senior Dance with their presence, and
whom else would Professor Knoblock ask but herself?</p>
<p>But of all things to happen just at this time, the
very next day Hinpoha came down with the mumps,
or rather the mump, for only one side of her throat
was affected. The first half she had had in childhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That horrid mump stayed away on purpose before,&rdquo;
she wailed, &ldquo;and waited all these years to
jump out on me just at this time. And my new
party dress is too sweet for anything, and my gilt
slippers&mdash;oh-oh-oh-oh was there ever such a disappointment?&rdquo;
Gladys and Sahwah and Katherine,
who had all had theirs &ldquo;on both sides&rdquo; and were
therefore allowed to call, were consumed with sympathy,
and were loud in their efforts to console the
stricken mumpee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Has <i>he</i> come to see you?&rdquo; ventured Gladys.</p>
<p>Hinpoha shook her head, which was a somewhat
painful process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he can&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; said Sahwah, &ldquo;he
probably hasn&rsquo;t had them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine&rsquo;s expression seemed to say that a really
brave knight wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to expose himself to
any danger for the sake of seeing his lady, seeing
which Hinpoha croaked hoarsely, &ldquo;They probably
wouldn&rsquo;t let him come,&rdquo; the &ldquo;they&rdquo; in this case
presumably referring to the school authorities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him down in Forester&rsquo;s this noon when I
was ordering the flowers for mother&rsquo;s birthday,&rdquo;
said Gladys, and they all sighed.</p>
<p>Just then the doorbell rang and Gladys, who was
sent to answer it, returned with a long box in her
hand addressed to &ldquo;Miss Dorothy Bradford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Foresters,&rdquo; said Sahwah breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flowers!&rdquo; said Gladys. &ldquo;Hurry and open them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The box disclosed a dozen, long-stemmed pink
roses. &ldquo;Oh! Ah!&rdquo; echoed the four in unison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From&mdash;him?&rdquo; asked Gladys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no card in the box,&rdquo; said Hinpoha, vainly
searching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be from him,&rdquo; said Gladys decidedly.
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t he in Forester&rsquo;s this morning? And it
seemed to me I heard him asking for pink roses.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Hinpoha put the flowers in a tall vase and regarded
them with rapture. They were the first
flowers ever sent to her by a man. In them she
found comfort for having to miss the dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he there?&rdquo; she inquired falteringly of
Gladys, the day after the party.</p>
<p>Gladys answered in the affirmative. &ldquo;Did&mdash;did
any of you dance with him?&rdquo; Hinpoha wanted to
know further.</p>
<p>Gladys shook her head. &ldquo;I saw him dancing
once or twice with Miss Snively,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe he stayed very long. He disappeared
before it was half over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hinpoha was satisfied. He had not enjoyed himself
without her. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it noble of him to dance
with Miss Snively?&rdquo; she said enthusiastically. &ldquo;No
one else would, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Commencement time the year before an old
Washington High graduate, who had attained fame
and fortune since his school days, presented the
school with funds to build a swimming pool. Work
had progressed during the year and now the pool
was completed and about to be dedicated. An elaborate
pageant was being prepared for the occasion.
Mermaids and water nymphs were to gambol about
in the green, glassy depths and lie on the painted
coral reefs; Neptune was to rise from the deep with
his trident; a garland bedecked barge was to bear
a queen and her attendants; and then after the pageant
there were to be swimming races, an exhibition
of diving and then a stunt contest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>The Winnebagos, being experienced swimmers,
were very much in the show. Sahwah had invented
a brand new and difficult dive, which she had christened
Mammy Moon; Hinpoha had learned the
amazing trick of sitting down in the water and
clasping her hands around her knees; Gladys could
swim the entire length of the pool with the leg
stroke only, holding a parasol over her head with
her hands, thus giving the impression that she was
taking a stroll on a sunshiny day. Katherine, alas,
could not swim. The largest body of water she had
seen at home had been the cistern, and most of the
time it was low tide in that. But this did not prevent
her from thinking up new and ludicrous stunts
for the others to do. It was she who invented the
&ldquo;Kite-tail&rdquo; stunt, which was one of the signal successes
on the night of the pageant. In this one of
the senior boys, who was a very powerful swimmer,
swam ahead with a rope tied around his waist, to
which another performer clung. Behind this second
one four or five more boys were strung out like the
tail of a kite, each one holding on to the heels of
the one ahead, and all towed by the first swimmer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>The great night arrived and the building which
housed the pool was crowded to the doors. The
Senior girls and boys had spent hours decorating
the hall with festoons of greens and potted palms
and ferns, so that it looked like the depths of a forest
in the center of which the pool glittered like a
magic spring. Cries of admiration rose from the
audience all around. Hinpoha, who in the first part
of the performance was a mermaid, with water lilies
plaited in her shining hair, saw only one face in the
crowd, and that was Professor Knoblock, as he
leaned over the polished brass rail and looked at her,
and looked, and looked, and looked. Only that day
Hinpoha, filled with the spirit of romance, had
slipped a note into the dictionary on his desk, at the
beginning of the letter &ldquo;L,&rdquo; the place where she had
put the lock of hair, thanking Professor Knoblock
for the flowers. An hour later, in sudden terror
that he would not find it there and someone else
would, she had gone to remove it. But it had vanished,
and in its place was another verse from Gareth
and Lynette:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O birds that warble to the morning sky,</p>
<p class="t0">O birds that warble as the day goes by,</p>
<p class="t0">Sing sweetly; twice my love hath smiled on me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>The opening of the pool was a success in every
way. The nymphs nymphed, and the mermaids
wagged their spangled tails to the delight and wonder
of the spectators, and the royal barge swept up
and down to the strains of stately music. Then the
pageant retired, the islands folded up their tents
and vanished, and the swimmers went behind the
scenes to prepare for the races and the stunts. To
bridge over this interval, Hinpoha had been left in
the pool all alone to amuse the crowd by floating on
a barrel and trying to balance a tray on her head
as she bobbed up and down. The crowd shouted with
laughter and cheered her wildly. All but one. With
arms crossed triumphantly over her breast and tray
steady on her head, Hinpoha looked up to see Miss
Snively standing by the edge regarding her with a
coldly sarcastic expression. It was as if she said in
words, &ldquo;Only such a flathead as you could balance
a tray on it.&rdquo; But the great happiness that surged
inside of Hinpoha made her charitable and forgiving
toward all the world, and she sent a sweet and
friendly smile into Miss Snively&rsquo;s face. But that
marble-hearted lady looked away. The next minute
there was a slip, a shriek, the flash of a silk dress,
and a splash, and Miss Snively had disappeared beneath
the surface at the deep end of the pool. Hurling
the tray into space Hinpoha made a magnificent
plunge for distance toward the spot where Miss
Snively had gone down. Simultaneously with her
plunge there was another movement in the crowd,
and Professor Knoblock, stripping off his coat,
jumped over the rail into the pool. Hinpoha
reached Miss Snively first, just as the blue silk appeared
on the surface, and, evading her wildly
clutching hand, managed to hold her head above
water while she struck out for the rail toward the
hands that were stretched down to her everywhere.
Then she became aware of another figure struggling
at her side. Professor Knoblock had come up after
his plunge, struck out blindly and then suddenly
doubled up and gone down again. Thrusting Miss
Snively hastily toward the helping hands, Hinpoha
turned and rescued her professor, who had miscalculated
his leap and struck his head on the side of
the pool. The whole business had not taken two
minutes since the first alarm, but Hinpoha was the
heroine of the hour. She was cheered and praised
and petted and patted on the head and exclaimed
over until she was quite bewildered. Her heart was
thumping until it deafened her. She had saved her
lover&rsquo;s life, and, bashful as he was, she knew that
now he must speak. It would not happen tonight.
They had rushed him home in a taxicab. But tomorrow&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Somehow she managed to finish her part in the
program and drink fruit punch in the gymnasium
afterward. While she stood in a corner cooling her
burning cheeks at an open window somebody came
and stood beside her. Hinpoha turned and faced
the Captain, and listened absent-mindedly to his
words of praise. Then one sentence he said caught
her attention. &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he said bashfully, &ldquo;how did
you like the flowers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What flowers?&rdquo; asked Hinpoha wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The roses&mdash;pink ones&mdash;I sent you when you had
the mumps.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>Hinpoha stared at him blankly, unbelievingly.
No, no, it could not be true, the roses had come from
her light-haired professor. &ldquo;Did <i>you</i> send them?&rdquo;
she asked in a tone in which no one could have detected
any degree of appreciation for the favor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t there any card in the box?&rdquo; asked the
Captain. &ldquo;I gave one to Mr. Forester to put in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Hinpoha, with a gulp, &ldquo;there
wasn&rsquo;t; and I thought&mdash;somebody else sent them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you like them?&rdquo; asked the Captain, feeling
in the air that something was wrong somewhere.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like roses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hinpoha pulled herself together with an effort.
Tears of disappointment were standing in her eyes.
&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; she answered politely, but without enthusiasm,
&ldquo;they were lovely; perfectly lovely.&rdquo; And she
ran hurriedly out of the corner, leaving the Captain
staring after her in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he sent them to me at all!&rdquo; she
told herself in the solitude of her own room that
night. &ldquo;The horrid thing found out that I got them
and told me that just to tease me. Anyway, it
doesn&rsquo;t make a particle of difference about Professor
Knoblock.&rdquo; And she fell asleep whispering to
herself with bated breath, &ldquo;Tomorrow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>She walked to school with lagging steps the next
morning. Now that the great hour was at hand she
was filled with a desire to flee. Then she heard
footsteps behind her, and, glancing out of the corner
of her eye, saw the professor approaching. With
a wildly beating heart she walked on, her face
straight to the front. He was coming. He was
overtaking her. Now he was upon her. With a
great effort she turned her head to look at him, her
lips parted in a tremulous smile. Professor Knoblock
raised his hat stiffly, nodded frigidly and passed
on without a word, leaving Hinpoha staring after
him stunned. Unseeingly she stumbled on to school.
One question was racing back and forth in her
mind like a shuttle in a loom&mdash;what was the meaning
of it? Classes recited around her in school; she
heard them as in a dream. Professor Knoblock did
not look at her as she entered the Literature class
room; he was taking two of the boys sharply to task
for never being able to recite. Hinpoha sat with her
eyes fixed on her book. Professor Knoblock was
evidently ill-humored this morning, though apparently
none the worse for his mishap the evening before.
He was dealing out zero marks right and left
if the recitations did not go like clock-work. And
as was only to be expected the morning after such
an elaborate affair as the dedication of a swimming
pool, clock-work recitations were very few and far
between.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>The professor finally lost all patience. &ldquo;Take
your books,&rdquo; he commanded, &ldquo;open and study the
lesson the remainder of the hour, and the first one I
see dawdling or whispering will be sent back to the
session room.&rdquo; Hinpoha&rsquo;s eyes followed the lines
on the page, but she could not have told what she
was reading. The question was still beating back
and forth in her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lend me your pencil,&rdquo; whispered her neighbor.
Mechanically she held it out to him and when he
took it he thrust a stick of gum into her hand. He
was still in a festive mood. Professor Knoblock
caught the movement. At the same moment another
pair in the back of the room began giggling about
something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two are out of order!&rdquo; shouted the professor.
&ldquo;Leave the room!&rdquo; All eyes were turned
toward the two in the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean you, George Hancock, and you, Dorothy
Bradford,&rdquo; said the Professor severely. Hinpoha
turned pleading, unbelieving eyes on him. &ldquo;Leave
the room,&rdquo; he repeated with rising anger, &ldquo;go back
to your session room!&rdquo; And with the world rocking
under her feet, Hinpoha went.</p>
<p>As the pupils came back from their respective
classes that noon there was a sensation in the air.
Groups of girls stood around whispering to one another
and exclaiming. &ldquo;Did you ever hear anything
like it?&rdquo; rose on all sides. &ldquo;Who would ever
dream of her getting&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hinpoha, dumb and miserable, sat apart, until
some one dragged her into the center of a group.
&ldquo;Have you heard the news?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered dully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Snively&rsquo;s engaged!&rdquo; announced a young
lady, in the same tone she would have said: &ldquo;The
sky has fallen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is!&rdquo; said Hinpoha. &ldquo;To whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor Knoblock!&rdquo; continued the speaker.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been engaged a long time&mdash;but it just
leaked out yesterday in a teachers&rsquo; meeting. That&rsquo;s
why he came here to teach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the notes he wrote me,&rdquo; moaned Hinpoha
to the Winnebagos, who had gathered for an indignation
meeting that afternoon. &ldquo;And the curl I
gave him&mdash;&mdash; Oh-oh-oh!&rdquo; and she hid her face in
her hands and groaned.</p>
<p>Katherine had been poking about in a corner of
the room during the preliminary wail. She now
came forward carrying a box in her hand which she
laid on Hinpoha&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; asked Hinpoha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open it and see,&rdquo; advised Katherine.</p>
<p>Hinpoha complied and there fell into her lap a
long, curling, red ringlet and a piece of paper written
over in Hinpoha&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a confession to make,&rdquo; said Katherine,
striking a dramatic attitude. &ldquo;I put that note into
your book asking for the lock of hair, and watched
until you put it into the dictionary. Then I took it
out after you left the room. I wrote the notes that
followed to keep the ball rolling. I don&rsquo;t believe
Professor Knoblock knows a thing about his great
romance with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You did it!&rdquo; cried Hinpoha blankly, turning
fiercely upon Katherine. &ldquo;You made such a fool
out of me that I&rsquo;ll never be able to show my face
again as long as I live. You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; sobs
choked her and cut off all utterance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the flowers,&rdquo; gasped Gladys, &ldquo;who sent
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain did, the mean old thing!&rdquo; sobbed Hinpoha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Key, and the Horoscope, and the Fortune
Teller,&rdquo; continued Gladys, &ldquo;they all said he
would be the one. I don&rsquo;t see how it could have
come out any other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine rose from her knees and rapped on the
table for attention. &ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; she said seriously, &ldquo;I
suppose you think it was a very unkind and low-down
sort of joke I played on Hinpoha, getting her
all worked up like that with those notes, and under
ordinary circumstances it would have been. But
isn&rsquo;t there a saying somewhere &lsquo;that awfully sick
people need awfully strong medicine,&rsquo; or something
to that effect? Here you all were gone completely
loony&mdash;excuse the expression, but it&rsquo;s just what you
were&mdash;gone perfectly loony about this fortune-telling
business. You did it so much that I actually
believe you began to think it was true. Then that
fool fortune-teller told Hinpoha about the light-haired
man that was coming into her life soon, and
when the new professor arrived you all thought he
was the one. I just happened to find out soon after
he came that he was engaged to Miss Snively. I
knew if I told you then you wouldn&rsquo;t believe it, so
I waited until it came out. But I was afraid Hinpoha
would do something really silly before she got
through, and decided to take a hand in the game myself.
When I wrote that note about the hair I was
sure she would see through it and come to her
senses. The fact that she swallowed it shows how
far out of her right mind she was. I never believed
she would put a lock of hair into the dictionary.
But when she seemed to take it all for gospel truth
I couldn&rsquo;t resist the temptation to go on and have
some more fun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;his handwriting,&rdquo; said Hinpoha faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easiest thing in the world to imitate,&rdquo; said Katherine,
saying nothing about the weary hours it had
taken her to accomplish that feat. &ldquo;And I signed
my own initial, &lsquo;K.,&rsquo; which was certainly not taking
the professor&rsquo;s name in vain. I never told a soul, so
there&rsquo;s nobody to crow over you. You stand just
exactly where you did at first with the professor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Gladys, still not satisfied, &ldquo;why did
he always look at Hinpoha when he read the sentimental
passages?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s built that way,&rdquo; answered Katherine
scornfully. &ldquo;There are plenty of men who will
make eyes at every pretty girl they see, whether
they have any right to or not. Besides I heard him
tell one of the other teachers once that your red
hair reminded him of the hair that belonged to a
dear friend he &lsquo;lost in youth.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After hearing Katherine&rsquo;s clean-cut and sensible
version of the affair the whole thing seemed unutterably
ridiculous and one by one they began to
think that she was right, and had played the part
of the friend instead of the mischief-maker, in
shocking Hinpoha back into common sense. Hinpoha
advanced shakily and held out her hand. &ldquo;I
thank you, Katherine,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for &lsquo;saving me
from myself&rsquo;!&rdquo; And Katherine seized her hand in
a crushing grip, and soon they were hugging each
other, and their friendship, instead of being shaken
to its foundations, was cemented more strongly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s horrid,&rdquo; said Gladys, &ldquo;and if I were
you, Hinpoha, I&rsquo;d never look at him again&mdash;the way
he treated you this morning, after you had taken
the trouble to fish him out of the pool last night.
He&rsquo;s an ungrateful wretch, and doesn&rsquo;t deserve to
be rescued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine was looking at them with a queer expression.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else I suppose I ought
to tell you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;although I wasn&rsquo;t going to
at first. But now he&rsquo;s acted so you really ought to
know. Miss Snively&rsquo;s falling into the pool wasn&rsquo;t
exactly an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did he push her in?&rdquo; asked Gladys in a horrified
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness, no,&rdquo; said Katherine. Then she
added: &ldquo;Yes, in a way he did, too, for he was responsible
for her falling in. You know what a
dub the boys all think him; they never call him anything
but &lsquo;that mutt,&rsquo; or &lsquo;that cissy.&rsquo; He couldn&rsquo;t
help seeing it, and it bothered him that he wasn&rsquo;t a
hero in their eyes. Besides,&rdquo; she continued
shrewdly, &ldquo;if he was thinking of getting married
he probably was looking for promotion, and he
never would get it as long as he couldn&rsquo;t control the
boys. So he complained to Miss Snively about it
and she obligingly offered to fall into the pool and
have him rescue her, and so make a hero out of him
overnight. I heard them planning it yesterday; they
were on one side of a big pile of greens waiting to
go up and I was on the other. She was to do it
during the intermission when no one was in the pool.
They didn&rsquo;t seem to know that you were going to
be in then. But she did it anyway, thinking that the
professor would reach her first. But you were too
quick for them. That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s so furious with
you; you kept him from being a hero, and got all the
praise he expected to get. Then when he bumped
his head on the side of the tank and had to be rescued
himself, it put the finishing touch to the tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; exclaimed Hinpoha and Sahwah and
Gladys and the other two girls, all in a breath. In
moments of great emotional stress refined language
seems an utter failure as a vehicle of expression.
Slang is the only thing that adequately expresses
the feelings. They said it again, intentionally and
emphatically&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Gee!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a foolish thing to do,&rdquo; said Sahwah, when
they had all recovered somewhat, &ldquo;falling into the
pool to give a man a chance to be a hero. She
might have been drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t run such an awful risk,&rdquo; observed
Katherine, the all-knowing. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a good swimmer
herself; I&rsquo;ve heard people say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again the girls sought relief in the expression
not sanctioned by the grammar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to the Lodge?&rdquo; said the Captain&rsquo;s voice in
Hinpoha&rsquo;s ear a few days later, as she swung along
the street. The Captain&rsquo;s manner was decidedly
diffident. He was not at all sure how she would
treat him this time.</p>
<p>Hinpoha nodded companionably. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
practice with the handball,&rdquo; she said energetically.
&ldquo;Come on, I&rsquo;ll race you across the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was great, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she cried laughingly,
as she stopped before the door, breathless,
with her hair flying around her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, give us a curl, will you?&rdquo; begged the Captain,
tugging at one that hung over the collar of her
coat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Captain,&rdquo; she said reprovingly.
&ldquo;You know I hate people who are sentimental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hinpoha&rsquo;s romance was a thing of the past.</p>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">RANDALL&rsquo;S ISLAND</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, it simply won&rsquo;t roll!&rdquo; exclaimed
Katherine in despair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tugged and tugged until
my fingernails are all broken, and it just naturally
won&rsquo;t turn over!&rdquo; And Katherine sat down
with a discouraged thud and fanned herself with a
hair-brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll &lsquo;just naturally&rsquo; have to stop and see
what&rsquo;s the matter with it,&rdquo; said Nyoda soothingly.
The Winnebagos were having a contest in poncho
rolling to be in practice for the coming summer&rsquo;s
camping trips. The aim of each one just now was
to accomplish this in two minutes. Two minutes to
spread out a poncho, two blankets and enough
clothes for an overnight trip, roll it up into a neat
stove-pipe, bend it into a tidy horseshoe and fasten
the ends together with a rope tied in square knots.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>The record was held by Medmangi, quiet, neat
Medmangi, who, while the others were working like
mad, had serenely completed her task in a minute
and three-quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a regular phenomenay, that woman,&rdquo; said
Sahwah, who had thought she was doing wonders
when she straightened up at the end of two minutes
exactly. &ldquo;She must have four hands, or else
she packed with her feet. But what else could you
expect of a girl who&rsquo;s going to be a doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Katherine, alas, made no time at all that
could be recorded in Nyoda&rsquo;s book. It was only
her second attempt at poncho rolling, but it is doubtful
whether it would have been any different if it
had been her hundred and second. She simply was
not built for order and speediness. At the end of
ten minutes she still sat beside her pile of belongings,
the poncho askew, the blankets askew on it
and hanging over the edge, the extra middy bundled
up into a wrinkled lump and the small articles
sliding off on all sides. She had begun to roll it
from the wrong end, and after one or two turns it
absolutely refused to go any farther, in spite of
forceful attempts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, spread your things out properly, and then
it will go,&rdquo; said Nyoda patiently, picking up the
blankets. Out rolled the object which had obstructed
the wheels of progress&mdash;an umbrella, which
had been tucked under the blankets lengthwise of
the roll. &ldquo;No wonder it wouldn&rsquo;t roll!&rdquo; exclaimed
Nyoda, laughing aloud. &ldquo;Did you expect the umbrella
to bend round and round like a hose? Whatever
would you want an umbrella for, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For rain,&rdquo; answered Katherine with touching
simplicity. Nyoda and the other Winnebagos doubled
up in silent mirth. Katherine&rsquo;s inspirations invariably
left them without power of comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katherine, you&rsquo;re <i>positively</i> hopeless,&rdquo; sighed
Gladys affectionately. &ldquo;The only safe way is to
divide your things up among the other ponchos;
yours would never arrive at a journey&rsquo;s end, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if I had only been born neat instead of
handsome!&rdquo; said Katherine plaintively, and then
joined heartily in the irresistible laughter that followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, girls!&rdquo; said Nyoda. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody
down at the door. Don&rsquo;t you hear somebody rapping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hinpoha, who was nearest the window, peeped
down. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a whole bunch of girls,&rdquo; she reported
in an excited whisper. &ldquo;All strangers. I don&rsquo;t
know any of them. What can they want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to see us, probably,&rdquo; said matter-of-fact
Sahwah. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t somebody going down to let them
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way this place looks!&rdquo; sighed Nyoda, looking
at the floor strewn with the contents of Katherine&rsquo;s
poncho. &ldquo;Gladys, you and Hinpoha go down
and let them in and detain them downstairs until
the rest of us can put this room in order. It&rsquo;s a
disgrace to the Winnebagos.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Gladys and Hinpoha descended the ladder and
threw open the door. &ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; they cried,
&ldquo;whoever you are! Welcome to the House of the
Open Door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The six strange girls came in. One who was
tall and thin and had hair almost as red as Hinpoha&rsquo;s,
stepped forward. &ldquo;We are members of the
San-Clu Camp Fire,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We have heard
quite a bit about you Winnebagos and thought we
would come and call. Is this your famous Lodge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is,&rdquo; said Gladys hospitably. &ldquo;We
are delighted to become acquainted with you. Make
yourselves at home. This gymnasium outfit belongs
to a club of boys who share our Lodge, and over
there is Sandhelo&rsquo;s stall. Sandhelo is our pet donkey;
you must see him right away.&rdquo; She led the
girls to the stall and kept them there telling about
Sandhelo&rsquo;s exploits until she was sure from the
sounds above that the room was in order. Then she
invited them to ascend the ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The San-Clu Camp Fire have come visiting,&rdquo;
she announced, as she stepped out on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All Hail to the San-Clu Camp Fire from the
Winnebagos,&rdquo; chanted the hostess ceremoniously,
and seven pairs of hands performed the fire sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;San-Clu returns All Hail,&rdquo; responded the guests
with no less ceremony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>The newcomers were shown the beauties of the
Winnebago Lodge, and it seemed they would never
get done exclaiming over the rugs and skins and
pottery, and most of all, the beds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t so terribly hard to make,&rdquo; the Winnebagos
assured them modestly, but at the same time
glowing with a feeling of superiority. The San-Clu
girls were plainly older than the Winnebagos;
they all wore dresses down to their ankles and
seemed quite grown up, almost enough to be guardians
themselves; yet they did not appear to have
won nearly so many honors as the younger Winnebagos.</p>
<p>During the tour of inspection Nyoda and Gladys
held a whispered consultation in one end of the
room. &ldquo;Nothing here to make a spread with,&rdquo; said
Gladys. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to hurry out and get something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said Nyoda. Gladys nudged Hinpoha and
drew her down the ladder and together they sped
after canned shrimp and condensed milk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse us a minute,&rdquo; said Nyoda
to the San-Clus, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll retire behind our curtains
and prepare to do the stunt with which we always
inflict company. Come, girls,&rdquo; she added in a whisper,
&ldquo;the Battle of Blenheim.&rdquo; And the players retired
to array themselves in the necessary sheets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>Five minutes later the curtains were shoved aside,
and the players stood before the audience. They
looked in bewilderment. For seated where they had
left the San-Clu Camp Fire Girls were the Captain,
Bottomless Pitt, the Monkey, Dan Porter, Peter
Jenkins and Harry Raymond. The girls had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, when did you come in, boys?&rdquo; asked Nyoda
in surprise. &ldquo;And where are the girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What girls?&rdquo; asked the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the San-Clu Camp Fire girls,&rdquo; said Nyoda,
&ldquo;who were visiting us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they are,&rdquo; said the six boys, rising and
speaking together. &ldquo;We are the &lsquo;San-Clu&rsquo; Camp
Fire Girls. &lsquo;San-Clu&rsquo;&mdash;short for Sandwich Club!
Ho-ho-ho, Katherine! You&rsquo;d know us in a minute
with girls&rsquo; clothes on, would you!&rdquo; And from under
the rugs and furniture they drew the dresses,
hats, gloves and wigs which the late San-Clus had
worn a-calling. &ldquo;Oh-h-h, Katherine, we do this to
each other!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls sat staring, speechless for a minute, unable
to believe that there really had been no girls
there. But the evidence was before their eyes and
it could not be doubted. And they were far too
game not to see that the joke was on them, and
laughed just as heartily over it as the boys did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to have the spread, anyhow, for your
benefit,&rdquo; said Nyoda, taking up the cans of supplies
that Hinpoha and Gladys had just brought in.
&ldquo;You carried that off too splendidly not to be rewarded.
We congratulate you on your ability to
act, and confess that we were completely taken in.
Where&rsquo;s Slim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We left him behind the fence,&rdquo; said the Captain,
with a start of recollection. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t dare let
him come in with us, because you&rsquo;d have recognized
him right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Figures never lie, especially stout ones,&rdquo; laughed
Nyoda. &ldquo;Go and bring him to the spread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you folks going on a trip?&rdquo; inquired the
Monkey, with his mouth full of Shrimp Wiggle and
his eyes on the ponchos piled in the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are, next Saturday,&rdquo; answered Sahwah.
&ldquo;We were just practicing rolling the ponchos today.
Saturday we&rsquo;re going to take the steamer across the
lake to Rock Island. Some friends of Nyoda&rsquo;s have
a cottage there, but they haven&rsquo;t gone up yet and
they said we might stay in it all night if we wanted
to. We&rsquo;re coming home on the boat Sunday
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going by yourselves?&rdquo; asked Slim, leaning
across the table and listening to the conversation.
He was fishing for an invitation for the Sandwiches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly are going by ourselves,&rdquo; said Sahwah,
to his disappointment. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been off
by ourselves for a long time. We&rsquo;re going in a
lonely place and have a Ceremonial Meeting on the
shore of the lake and tell secrets and do stunts and
have a beautiful time. It&rsquo;s strictly a Winnebago
affair&mdash;a hen party, you&rsquo;d call it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Slim sighed and consoled himself with five pieces
of fudge and an apple. He was one of those boys
who like to be around girls all the time. Too fat to
enjoy the more strenuous society of the boys, he
preferred to sit with his gentler friends and dip his
hand into the dishes of candy that they usually had
standing around. The fact that they made no end
of fun of him and never took him seriously only
increased his desire for them. And, like the Captain,
he delighted to look upon the hair when it was
red. He admired Hinpoha with all his corpulent
soul.</p>
<p>The winter and spring months had flown by with
swifter wings than the white-tailed swallow, and
the clock of the year was once more striking June.
Saturday found the Winnebagos skimming over the
blue waters of the lake in the big daily excursion
boat bound for Rock Island. Nakwisi, of course,
had her spy glass and was carefully scrutinizing the
empty horizon. &ldquo;Has Katherine come into your
range of vision yet?&rdquo; asked Nyoda, a trifle anxiously.
Katherine had boarded the boat with them
safely enough, for she had been personally conducted
from home by the whole six, but had disappeared
within ten minutes after the boat started.</p>
<p>Nakwisi lowered her glass and laughed. &ldquo;No, I
don&rsquo;t see her in the sky,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;though I
shouldn&rsquo;t be very greatly surprised if I did.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>And they began a thorough search of the boat
from top to bottom and finally found her hanging
over the rail of a gangway, trying to touch the
snowy foam flying in the swirling wake of the paddle
wheel. It was the first time she had ever been on a
lake, and she took a perfectly childish delight in the
racing water. Pulled back to safety by Nyoda, she
gave an animated account of her adventures since
seeing them last, in the course of which she had
nearsightedly walked into the pilot house and caught
hold of the wheel to steady herself when the boat
gave a lurch, and had been summarily put out by
an angry first mate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been everywhere on the
boat except down the smokestack,&rdquo; she concluded
triumphantly.</p>
<p>Soon Rock Island appeared as a speck on the
horizon in Nakwisi&rsquo;s glass, then as a long black
streak which they could all see, and finally grew by
leaps and bounds into a beautiful wooded island
with trees and lawns and beautiful summer cottages
shining in the sunlight. Shouldering their ponchos,
they went ashore, and walked around the point of
the island to the cottage where they were to spend
the night. It was close to the water, where a curving
indentation of the shore line made a lovely little
beach. If Sahwah did not make the record at
poncho rolling, she left them all behind in getting
into her bathing suit, and five minutes after the
door was unlocked her hands clove the water in a
flying dive from the end of the pier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>Katherine splashed about courageously, trying to
swim, and finally succeeded in propelling herself
through the water by a series of jerks and splashes
unlike any stroke ever invented by the mind of man.
&ldquo;This is too hard on my dellyket constitooshun,&rdquo;
she remarked at last, clambering out and draping
her ungainly length around a rock, thereby disclosing
the fact that her bathing suit was minus one
sleeve. Katherine regarded the yawning armhole
with mild vexation. &ldquo;Broke my needle when my suit
was all done but putting in the one sleeve,&rdquo; she remarked
serenely, &ldquo;and there wasn&rsquo;t time to go out
and buy one&mdash;I finished the suit at eleven o&rsquo;clock
last night&mdash;so I just pasted that sleeve in with adhesive
tape, and it didn&rsquo;t show a bit. But it must
have let go in the water,&rdquo; she finished plaintively.
Nyoda looked at the girls, and the girls looked at
Nyoda, and once more they were dumb.</p>
<p>Tired of swimming, they dressed and explored the
island and then sat down on the big boat dock and
dangled their feet over the edge. Soon a tug came
up alongside the pier and the sailor who ran it
chanced to be a man whom Nyoda had met the previous
summer on the island. &ldquo;Hello, Captain McMichael,&rdquo;
she called.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>The sunburnt sailor looked up. &ldquo;Hello, hello,&rdquo;
he answered. &ldquo;What are you doing up here so early
in the season?&rdquo; When Nyoda had explained that
she had brought the girls up on a sightseeing trip,
Captain McMichael promptly offered to take them
for a ride in the tug. &ldquo;Got to go over to Jackson&rsquo;s
Island and get a lighter of limestone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
have to set you ashore on Randall&rsquo;s Island while I
went over to Jackson&rsquo;s to get the lighter,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;because you&rsquo;d get all covered with lime dust
if you stayed in the tug while they were loading,
and it&rsquo;s no place for ladies to go ashore. But Randall&rsquo;s
is all right. The quarries there aren&rsquo;t worked
any more and there are only a few summer cottages.
But there are excellent wild strawberries,&rdquo; he finished
with a twinkle in his eye. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call for you
on the way back and get you here before dark. Will
you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nyoda, may we?&rdquo; cried the girls, delighted
at the prospect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; answered Nyoda. &ldquo;I think that will
be a delightful way to spend the afternoon. I have
always wanted to explore Randall&rsquo;s Island; it looks
so interesting from the steamer. We accept your
invitation with pleasure, Captain McMichael.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to have you,&rdquo; responded the tug master
heartily, as he set the powerful engine throbbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fall overboard,&rdquo; he yelled above the steam
exhaust a minute later as Katherine hung over the
stern and trailed her hands in the water. Nyoda
clung to her dress and the rest sang in chorus:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sailing, sailing,</p>
<p class="t">Over to Randall&rsquo;s I,</p>
<p class="t0">And dear Sister K would fall into the bay</p>
<p class="t">If Nyoda weren&rsquo;t nigh!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The run to Randall&rsquo;s Island took just fifteen minutes
and Katherine managed to get there without
accident, other than upsetting an oil can into her
lap. The wild strawberries were as abundant and
as delicious as Captain McMichael had promised,
and it was with sighs of regret that they finally admitted
they could hold no more. Then they scrambled
around in the abandoned limestone quarries until
Nyoda, coming face to face with Katherine, announced
it was time to play something else. Katherine
had torn her dress on sharp points until it
was nearly a wreck; she had stepped into a puddle
up to her shoetops, her hat brim hung down in a
discouraged loop and her hands and face were
scratched with briers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If one more thing happens to you, Katherine
Adams,&rdquo; said Nyoda sternly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have to spend
the rest of your life on this island, for you won&rsquo;t
be respectable enough to take home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be Miss Robinson Crusoe,&rdquo; said Katherine,
&ldquo;and eat up all the strawberries on the island,
and not have to write the class paper. I believe I&rsquo;ll
consider your offer. Our literary member, Migwan,
can write a book about it&mdash;<i>Living on Limestone</i>, or
<i>The Queen of the Quarry</i>. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a fine
sounding title!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is that long stone building way over
there?&rdquo; asked Hinpoha, as they promenaded decorously
over the island beyond the quarries, two of
them arm-in-arm with Katherine, to keep her in the
straight and narrow path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a fort,&rdquo; said Sahwah, with immediate
interest. &ldquo;Is it a fort, Nyoda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it very much,&rdquo; answered Nyoda. &ldquo;I
never heard of a fort on any of these islands.
Let&rsquo;s go over and investigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine hung back, screwing up her face and
rolling her eyes like an old negress. &ldquo;Don&rsquo; lead dis
child into temptation,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Feel lak de
climbin&rsquo; debbil would get into mah feet agin foh
sartin sure, ef ah went near dat pile of stone, an&rsquo; den
good-bye, dress! Only safe way&rsquo;s to keep dis child
far away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her veiled, husky voice made her imitation indescribably
droll, and the girls shouted with laughter.
&ldquo;Never fear, my weak sister,&rdquo; said Gladys, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
all keep you out of danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine what this could have been,&rdquo; said
Hinpoha, when they had reached the ruin. &ldquo;It
looks more like a mill than a fort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mill!&rdquo; exclaimed Sahwah scornfully. &ldquo;There
isn&rsquo;t any wheel, and there isn&rsquo;t a sign of a stream.
Mills are always on streams.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe this was a windmill,&rdquo; suggested Katherine.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s windy enough to set any kind of machinery
going,&rdquo; and she started in pursuit of her hat,
which that moment had been whirled from her head
by a mischievous zephyr.</p>
<p>The ruin which the girls had found that afternoon
was the remains of an old wine cellar which had
been used for storing great quantities of grape wine
in the old days when Randall&rsquo;s Island had been in
the heart of the grape region, before quarrying became
the chief industry. Nothing was left now to
tell what valuable stores it had once sheltered, only
stones and crumbling brick walls, overgrown with
high weeds and wild vines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an enchanted castle,&rdquo; said Hinpoha. &ldquo;A
beautiful princess used to live here, only she got
married and moved to&mdash;to the big hotel on Rock
Island, and when she left the bad imps came and
knocked out the mortar with their little hammers
and it all fell to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, wonderful,&rdquo; drawled Katherine. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
poke about a bit in the ruins and see if we can find
any of the solid gold toothpicks the princes used to
strew around after a meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ruined wine cellar proved utterly fascinating.
They could still see where it had been divided into
rooms; and here and there a thick wall still stood
higher than their heads.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; asked Katherine, as they stood
before a doorway partially filled with d&eacute;bris, behind
which a black hole yawned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cave,&rdquo; said Sahwah, poking her head forward
into the hole like a turtle. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s explore it,&rdquo;
she continued, stepping carefully over the pile of
bricks. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; she called over her shoulder;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s perfectly wonderful. It&rsquo;s a room, but it&rsquo;s under
the hill. Come on in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any bats?&rdquo; asked Gladys, hanging
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but brickbats,&rdquo; came Sahwah&rsquo;s cheerful
voice from within.</p>
<p>Gladys and Hinpoha crawled through the opening,
and Katherine, with a resigned, &ldquo;Goodbye,
dress,&rdquo; followed with Nyoda and Nakwisi and Medmangi.
The room was nothing more than an extension
of the cellar, built into the side of the hill,
but to them it was filled with romantic possibilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose it was?&rdquo; asked Hinpoha,
straining her eyes in the semi-darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dungeon, of course,&rdquo; answered Katherine
promptly. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where your beautiful princess
confined the lovers that didn&rsquo;t suit her fancy&mdash;light-haired
ones and fat ones, especially. She chained
them to the wall and the rats nibbled their toes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-oh-oh!&rdquo; shrieked Hinpoha, stopping her
ears. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say such dreadful things. I can feel
the rats nibbling at my toes this minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>The walls of this cellar were badly crumbled, and
at the farther side the girls discovered another cave-like
opening. This was entirely dark and they hesitated
before going in. Then Nyoda took her pocket
flash and Gladys found hers, and by the combined
glimmer of the two the girls found their way into
the farther cave. At first they had to keep the light
on the ground to see where to put their feet and
they were all inside before Nyoda turned her flash
on the walls. Then a great cry of amazement burst
from every girl, ending in a breathless gasp. The
walls and roof of the cave seemed to be made of
precious stones&mdash;pearls, sapphires, emeralds, amethysts
and diamonds. They caught the gleam from
the pocket flashes and twinkled and reflected in a
hundred points of dancing light. Great masses of
crystal, faceted like diamonds, hung suspended from
the roof almost touching their heads, seemingly held
up by magic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I dreaming,&rdquo; cried Hinpoha, &ldquo;or is this Alladin&rsquo;s
cave? What is it, Nyoda? Where are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nyoda laughed at their open mouths and staring
eyes. &ldquo;Only in one of Nature&rsquo;s treasure vaults,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;This is one of the famous crystal caves
that are found throughout these islands. It&rsquo;s a form
of rock crystal, strontia, I believe some people call
it, and I don&rsquo;t doubt but what it&rsquo;s related to the limestone
in the quarries. Take a good look at it, for
some of these crystals are simply marvellous.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>Their voices echoed and re-echoed weirdly, as
they called to each other, the sound seeming to roll
along the low ceiling. &ldquo;Look at this mass over
here,&rdquo; cried Sahwah, penetrating deeper into the
cave, &ldquo;it looks like a man standing against the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this one looks like a dog lying down,&rdquo; said
Hinpoha, pointing to another.</p>
<p>Laughing, shouting, exclaiming, they explored the
wonders of the cave until a heavy shock as of something
falling, accompanied by a deafening crash,
rooted them to the ground with fright. &ldquo;What is
it? What has happened?&rdquo; they asked one another,
and made their way back to the entrance. But the
entrance was no longer there. Where it had been
there was a solid wall of stone. Their climbing
around among the ruined walls had sent some of
the bricks sliding and these had released a large
rock which had rolled down directly over the opening
into the crystal cave. With desperate force
they pushed against the rock, but their sevenfold
strength made no more impression than a fly brushing
its wings against it. With white faces they
turned to each other when they realized the truth.
They were imprisoned in the cave!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The other direction!&rdquo; cried Sahwah, shaking off
her terror and setting her wits to work. &ldquo;We may
be able to get out the other way.&rdquo; Taking the flashlight
from Gladys, whose trembling fingers threatened
to drop it, she led the way into the gloomy recesses
of the cave, whose depths they had penetrated
only a short distance before. They shuddered at the
icicle like crystals, which now seemed like long fingers
reaching down to catch a hold of them, and
shrank back from the crystal masses that took the
forms of men and animals. These now seemed like
ghosts of creatures that had been trapped in the
cave as they were. For trapped they were. In a
few moments their progress was barred by impassable
masses of crystal. Back again they went to the
rock-blocked entrance and beat upon it and pushed
with all their might. All in vain. The rock stood
firm as Gibraltar. They shouted and called and
screamed until the echoes clamored hideously, but
no answering call came from the outside. From
somewhere, far in the distance, came the dismal
sound of falling water, chilling the blood in their
veins.</p>
<p>Helplessly the girls all turned to Nyoda, asking,
&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nyoda stood still and tried to face the situation
calmly. She held her flashlight close to the rock
and looked carefully all around the edge. At one
side there was a tiny fissure, not more than half an
inch wide and about six inches long, caused by the
irregular shape of the rock. Nyoda regarded this
minute opening thoughtfully. &ldquo;If we could put
something through that opening which would act as
a signal, we might attract somebody&rsquo;s attention who
wouldn&rsquo;t be able to hear us calling,&rdquo; she said at
length. &ldquo;Our voices are so muffled in here they
can&rsquo;t carry very far outside.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anybody on the island to see it?&rdquo; asked
Gladys doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some people here,&rdquo; answered Nyoda,
&ldquo;because the fishermen stay all the year round. You
remember those houses we passed on the other side
of the quarry, where the nets were hanging in the
yard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we use for a signal of distress?&rdquo;
asked Gladys. &ldquo;Not one of us has a tie or a ribbon
on today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use my dress skirt,&rdquo; said Katherine generously.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so torn anyway that it&rsquo;ll never feel the same
again, even if it recovers from this trip.&rdquo; Which
was perfectly true. So they tore the wide hem from
her dress, which made a pennant about six feet long.
Then Sahwah had a further inspiration, and, dipping
her finger into a dark puddle formed on the
floor by a thin stream of moisture trickling down the
wall, she wrote the word HELP on the strip. Nyoda
poked the end through the opening and shoved
the rest out after it, keeping the other end in her
hand, and she could feel by the tugging at the strip
that the high wind had caught the portion outside
and was whipping it about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now shout for all you&rsquo;re worth,&rdquo; commanded
Nyoda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>Early that Saturday morning the Captain had
aroused Slim from his peaceful slumbers unceremoniously.
&ldquo;Hurry up and come over,&rdquo; he said, in
response to Slim&rsquo;s protesting grunt. &ldquo;Uncle Theodore&rsquo;s
here with his automobile and he&rsquo;s going to
take a run over to Freeport this morning and he
said he would take all the fellows along that were
ready at nine o&rsquo;clock. Hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slim needed no second invitation and roused himself
immediately, while the Captain sped to collect
the remainder of the Sandwiches, which was accomplished
in short order, as none of the other invitations
involved resurrection. Nine o&rsquo;clock found
them all on the curbstone before the Captain&rsquo;s house,
standing beside Uncle Theodore&rsquo;s big car, waiting
for the word to pile in. The ride to Freeport was
accomplished in a few hours&rsquo; time and after dinner
Uncle Theodore turned the boys loose to see the
town by themselves while he transacted the business
which had taken him thither. Freeport had no attraction
outside of its harbor, and thither the boys
betook themselves without delay. Passenger steamers
left every half hour for the various islands
nearby; lime boats, tugs and scows crowded the
mouth of the river, and the whole atmosphere
breathed of ships. The boys stood and watched a
while and then pined for something to do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hire a launch,&rdquo; suggested the Captain, who
felt that it was up to him to furnish the amusement,
inasmuch as he had invited them to come along,
&ldquo;and go out on the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launches were readily to be had and soon they
were curving around in great circles through the
waves, drenched with the spray, and enjoying it as
only boys can enjoy the sensation of riding in a
speed boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to Rock Island,&rdquo; said Slim, who had
not forgotten who else had planned to go there that
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; answered Slim, &ldquo;except that
there&rsquo;s a pretty nice aquarium there, and&mdash;and the
girls said they were going to be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we were politely invited to stay home, if I
remember rightly,&rdquo; said Bottomless Pitt. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
going to have a pow-wow, or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if we should run into them accidentally they
would probably be glad to see us,&rdquo; persisted Slim.
Slim was fond of picnics gotten up by girls on account
of the superior quality of the &ldquo;grub&rdquo;; he was
especially fond of Winnebago picnics, because the
Winnebagos treated him better than any other girls
he knew, and as mentioned before, he had a decided
weakness for red hair. Hence his ingenuous desire
to go to Rock Island. The Captain, knowing Slim
like a book, laughed. But he, too, wished he had
been invited to the picnic, and his reasons coincided
in their last item with Slim&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, and turned the boat&rsquo;s head
toward the green outline of Rock Island. Half of
the distance across the bay the launch wheezed and
stopped dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw,&rdquo; said Slim disgustedly, when the Captain
announced that they had run out of gasoline.
They had come to a stop just off a small rocky
island and with the aid of the one oar the launch
boasted the Captain proceeded to paddle in to shore,
in the hope that he could obtain gasoline there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regular desert island,&rdquo; grunted Slim, as they
walked and met no one. &ldquo;None of the cottages
seem to be occupied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up; we&rsquo;ll find someone,&rdquo; said the Captain.
&ldquo;The fishermen live on these islands all winter.
Look at the limestone quarries over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the ruined something or other behind
them,&rdquo; said the Bottomless Pitt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s cut across here,&rdquo; said Slim, who was ever
on the lookout for short cuts. &ldquo;I see some houses
over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And break our necks crawling over those stones,&rdquo;
said Monkey. &ldquo;Not much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they started to follow the path that led around
the curve of the shore. &ldquo;Wonder if it wouldn&rsquo;t
have been better to cut across, anyway,&rdquo; said the
Captain, when they had gone some distance. &ldquo;These
blooming little stones are worse to walk on than
spikes. Those rocks couldn&rsquo;t have been much
worse.&rdquo; And he stood still and looked thoughtfully
back at the ruined cellar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s what?&rdquo; asked Slim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That white rag flying from the rock over there.
It surely wasn&rsquo;t there a minute ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably was, only you didn&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; said Slim,
impatient to go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m positive it wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going over to have a look at it. When rags start
out of rocks there&rsquo;s something in the wind.&rdquo; And
he walked briskly toward it, the rest following. As
they drew near their startled eyes fell on the black
letters of the word HELP, traced in wobbly lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; shouted the boys at the top of their lungs.
&ldquo;Where are you and what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently from inside the rock came the feeble
echo of a shout: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the cave! The rock
covered the doorway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; called the Captain in answer,
and boylike tried to move the rock himself. &ldquo;Lend
a hand, fellows,&rdquo; he said, after one shove against
its solid side. They lent all the hands they had, but
could not budge it. &ldquo;Pull the bricks out from
around it,&rdquo; commanded the Captain, taking charge
of the affair like a general, &ldquo;and look out for your
feet when she lunges over!&rdquo; They set to work, dislodging
the bricks that held it in, and before long
it moved, tottered, grated and finally, with a great
crash, lunged over and rolled down a little slope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>Pale and shaken, the Winnebagos emerged into
the light of day. Had the ghosts of their great
grandmothers appeared before them the boys could
not have been more surprised. Questions and answers
flew back and forth thick and fast until the
tale of their finding the cave was told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll never, never, explore anything again!&rdquo;
finished Hinpoha, in an emphatic tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you will,&rdquo; said Gladys; &ldquo;and so will we
all, but the next time we&rsquo;ll have a company of guides
fore and aft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a better plan,&rdquo; suggested the
Captain mildly, &ldquo;to take us along with you wherever
you go? I notice we generally have to come to the
rescue, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Winnebagos promised to consider the
matter.</p>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">KINDLING THE TORCH</span></h2>
<p>Hinpoha and Sahwah were patiently teaching
Katherine hand signs one Saturday afternoon when
Gladys burst in with a tragic face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; she cried, with extravagant emphasis,
&ldquo;have you heard the <i>news</i>?&rdquo; Then, without waiting
for reply, she continued: &ldquo;Nyoda&rsquo;s going to be
<i>married</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know she is,&rdquo; answered Hinpoha, &ldquo;a year
from this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not a year from this summer,&rdquo; said Gladys,
swelling with the importance of the announcement
she was about to make, &ldquo;<i>this</i> summer. This very
month!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An incredulous exclamation burst from the three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; continued Gladys. &ldquo;Sherry&rsquo;s going
to be sent away on a long trip and he wants to take
her with him, so they&rsquo;re going to be married right
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All four sat stricken, trying to realize that the
evil day which they had dreaded so and which they
had thought far in the future was actually upon
them. Only two more weeks and their idolized
Guardian, who for three years had been a part of
nearly everything they did, would be gone from
them. It seemed that the world was coming to an
end.</p>
<p>In the days that followed gloom hung thick over
the House of the Open Door. Now that Nyoda was
to be in it no longer the Winnebagos lost all joy in
its possession. Each article of furniture that she
had helped to make, each sketch of hers on the wall
telling in clever little pictographs the tale of some
adventure or frolic, gripped them with a fresh pang.
Plans for summer excursions and activities were
dropped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And we were all going ca-camping togu-gether!&rdquo;
wailed Hinpoha, and damp weather prevailed for
many minutes.</p>
<p>But this was the end of their Senior year in high
school, crowded to the limit with all the bustle and
excitement and festivity of Commencement time,
and the Winnebagos were so busy with examinations
and essays and clothes and songs and parties that
there was no time to fold their hands and grieve.
Katherine, as editor of the class paper, was the star
performer on Class Night, although Miss Snively,
who trained the speakers, had tried to sandpaper
her speech of everything clever. Katherine agreed
to every change she suggested with suspicious readiness,
and then when the night arrived calmly read
her original paper, while the chandeliers dripped
giggles and Miss Snively made sarcastic remarks
about the cracked-voice orator. Somehow the story
of Miss Snively&rsquo;s attempt to make a hero out of her
fianc&eacute; had gotten out, although Katherine always
looked preoccupied whenever the subject was mentioned,
and of late Miss Snively had found the seats
in her recitation room occupied by rows of wise
grins, which somewhat disturbed her lofty dignity.
It was well that this was to be her last year of teaching.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>One of the big events of the last week was the
interscholastic track meet and athletic contest, to
be held on the Washington High athletic field, in
which ten big schools took part. The field was
thronged with spectators, the grand stand was
crowded, school colors floated from tree and pole,
cheers burst from groups of students every few
minutes and the air was electric with suppressed
excitement.</p>
<p>First came the track events, and in these Washington
High was tied with Carnegie Mechanic for
second place. The Winnebagos were glad it was
so, because now the Sandwiches could not crow over
them. The Captain finished first in one of the hundred-yard
dashes right in front of Hinpoha, where
she sat in the grandstand, and he looked over the
heads of the cheering boys straight at her. Hinpoha
dared not applaud him, because he belonged to
Washington&rsquo;s bitterest rival, but she smiled brightly,
and he dropped his eyes, flushing suddenly.</p>
<p>The girls&rsquo; events opened with a game of volley
ball between Washington High and Carnegie Mechanic.
Much to the surprise of the Winnebagos,
they saw Katherine come in with the Washington
players. Katherine was not on the team. But just
before the game opened the girl&rsquo;s gymnasium director
had spied Katherine sitting at one side of the
field, unconcernedly shaking a pebble out of her shoe
in full view of the grandstand, and hurried over to
her. &ldquo;Will you fill in this game?&rdquo; she asked breathlessly.
&ldquo;One of our team can&rsquo;t come and we&rsquo;re short
a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve never played volley ball,&rdquo; protested
Katherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the gymnasium teacher disappointedly.
Then she added in a kind of desperation, &ldquo;Well, I
don&rsquo;t know as it makes any difference. I don&rsquo;t seem
to be able to find a girl who has played. Just stay
in the background and strike at the ball with the
palms of your hands every time it comes near you.
Let the girls in front get it over the net.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine uncurled her length from the ground
and followed the gymnasium teacher obligingly.
She was not in the least sensitive about being asked
at the eleventh hour to &ldquo;fill in,&rdquo; when she had not
been asked to be on the team before. Washington&rsquo;s
volley ball team was not a very strong one, and
went all to pieces against the concentrated team
work of the Carnegie Mechanicals. The score rolled
up against Washington steadily. The deafening
yells from the grandstand bewildered them, and they
could neither volley the ball over the net nor return
the Mechanicals&rsquo; volleys. They were helpless
from stage fright.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>Katherine dutifully stayed in the background,
sending the ball to the girls at the net, her brow
drawing into anxious puckers, as they fumbled it
time after time. She began to comprehend the rules
of the game and was &ldquo;getting the hang of it.&rdquo; The
Mechanicals, with fifteen points to their credit, had
just lost the ball by sending it out of bounds. It
was time to do something. Katherine had noticed
that most of the Washington girls had been trying
to volley the ball across the net from the back line,
instead of passing it on, as she had been doing, and
had been falling short nearly every time. With a
commanding gesture, she claimed the attention of
her team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back on the volley line in a row,&rdquo; she ordered.
They obeyed her like sheep. Then she took
her place half-way between the volley line and the
net, facing the girls. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said crisply, &ldquo;whosoever&rsquo;s
turn it is to volley, shoot the ball to me and
not an inch farther. I&rsquo;ll get it over the net. The
first one that shoots it over my head is going to get
ducked in the swimming pool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In their surprise at this sudden rising up of a
leader, they forgot the racket around them, and the
triumphantly clamoring team on the other side of
the net, and calmed down. The girl with the ball
sent it straight toward Katherine, and with a windmill
motion of her powerful arms, she hit it a sounding
whack and sent it over the net like a meteor.
There was no returning such a volley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One!&rdquo; cried the scorekeeper, and the Washington
corner of the grandstand gave its first yell of
triumph.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, everyone of you do just the same thing,
one after another,&rdquo; commanded Katherine to the
volley line. Her utter lack of excitement was bringing
them out of their confusion. The next girl
made an equally good throw and another loud whack
announced that Katherine was volleying. Backing
the net, she could not see where it was going, but a
squeal told her that the girl who should be returning
the ball was fleeing it. Then the machine started
to work. As long as one side scored it was privileged
to keep the volley.</p>
<p>When in operation the machine sounded like this:
&ldquo;Next!&rdquo; Whack! Bump! That was all. Katherine&rsquo;s
command to the server; the impact of her
palms on the ball; and the thump of the ball on the
ground on the Mechanical side of the net. Up went
the Washington score.</p>
<p>Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven!
Eight! Nine! Ten! Eleven! Twelve!</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Washington Rah!</p>
<p class="t0">Washington Rah!</p>
<p class="t0">Katherine Adams,</p>
<p class="t0">Rah! Rah! Rah!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The atmosphere was rent with the yell.</p>
<p>Thirteen! Fourteen! Fifteen!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next!&rdquo; Whack! Bump!</p>
<p>SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN! EIGHTEEN!
NINETEEN! TWENTY!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;WASHINGTON RAH!</p>
<p class="t0">KATHERINE RAH!</p>
<p class="t0">KATHERINE AD&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>TWENTY-ONE!</p>
<p class="tb">The umpire ran along the net, holding up her
hands, and the teams broke ranks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Washington High winner in the volley ball
game!&rdquo; shouted the scorekeeper through her megaphone.
&ldquo;Score, twenty-one to fifteen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the grandstand thundered at Katherine, who
suddenly got stage fright when it was all over and
stood pigeon-toed with her head hanging down.
Then she noticed for the first time that her middy
was on hind side before and the long collar was
down in front. Her horrified expression threw the
spectators into convulsions. They had been laughing
at it all through the game, but her amazing performance
had made it a secondary consideration.</p>
<p>A few moments later she strolled nonchalantly
into the grandstand and sat down among the Winnebagos.
&ldquo;That certainly is a strenuous game for a
person with a dellyket constitooshun like mine,&rdquo; she
remarked ruefully, rubbing her swollen knuckles.
Three fingers were sprained as a result of doing all
the volleying for twelve girls, but she didn&rsquo;t think it
worth while to mention the matter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>Thus passed the days, filled to overflowing with
fun and excitement. Katherine, thoroughly uncomfortable
in a crisp new white dress and blue sash,
tripped blithely along the elm-shaded avenue in the
glow of the late June sunset. It was the night of
the class banquet, and her mind was intent on the
speech she was to make. Thus absorbed, she did
not watch where she was going, and a sprawling
root from a big tree tripped her unexpectedly and
brought her to her knees on the soft lawn. Brought
into such close contact with the ground, she spied
something lying at the foot of the giant oak beside
which she had fallen. It was a black leather bill
fold, with a heavy elastic band around it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daggers and dirks!&rdquo; said Katherine, borrowing
the Captain&rsquo;s favorite expression. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;
She slipped off the elastic band and opened the bill
fold. Across the inner flap there was a name printed
in gold letters. Katherine squinted at the name and
explored the inner recesses of the wallet. She took
one look and hastily bound the wallet together again
with its elastic and dropped it gingerly into her hand
bag, as if it were red hot. Then she proceeded on
her way, more absorbed than ever, but the thing her
brain was intent on now was not her banquet speech.</p>
<p>Crossing the little park-like square, which lay on
the way to school, she came upon Veronica walking
slowly up and down the sidewalk, intently searching
for something on the ground. She was very
pale and showed signs of great agitation. It was
the first time Katherine had met her face to face
since she had left the group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you lost something?&rdquo; asked Katherine abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Veronica, straightening up and flushing
deeply, &ldquo;that is, nothing much, I&mdash;I just dropped
a&mdash;something out of my purse along here somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; asked Katherine.</p>
<p>Veronica gave a last frantic look along the walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a&mdash;&rdquo; She hesitated, and then burst out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Katherine, it was my bill fold, and it had five
hundred dollars in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five hundred dollars!&rdquo; echoed Katherine faintly.</p>
<p>Veronica ran back and forth along the walk, looking
desperately into every crack and crevice. Every
few minutes she held up her hand and looked at her
wrist watch; then she would return to the search
with more energy than before. Katherine also
looked at her watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you hunt,&rdquo; she said, taking the other
side of the walk. &ldquo;Are you sure you lost it along
here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty sure,&rdquo; answered Veronica. &ldquo;I know I
had it when I was back on Elm Street, because I
looked to make sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last time you saw it was back on Elm
Street,&rdquo; mused Katherine. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s two blocks behind
us. We&rsquo;ll have to go all the way back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Katherine, a few minutes
later, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s none of my business, I suppose, but what
on earth were you doing with five hundred dollars
in your bag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Veronica started and looked confused for a minute.
But she answered naturally enough. &ldquo;I drew
it from the bank this afternoon to give my uncle to
pay for some investment he is making for me, and
I was to take it over to his studio, but I was detained
and he had gone when I got there, so I was
just bringing it home when I lost it.&rdquo; She stared
up the road with widening eyes, not toward Elm
Street, where the purse might lie, but toward the
big avenue in the other direction, where the streetcars
clanged townward. Katherine stared thoughtfully
at the suitcase Veronica had with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been away?&rdquo; she asked casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Veronica, with a start. Then, as her
eyes followed Katherine&rsquo;s, she added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just
been carrying some&mdash;things in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine looked at her watch again. &ldquo;What did
your bill fold look like?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a small black one,&rdquo; answered Veronica,
&ldquo;with an elastic band around it. It had my name in
gold letters across the inner flap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better go home and tell your uncle,&rdquo;
suggested Katherine, &ldquo;and get him to help us find
it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried Veronica, shrinking back in
alarm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell him! I wouldn&rsquo;t have him know
for worlds that I&rsquo;ve lost it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you don&rsquo;t find it he&rsquo;ll know about it, anyway,&rdquo;
said Katherine practically.</p>
<p>Veronica&rsquo;s face went white again and she returned
to the search with desperate haste. &ldquo;I must
find it! I must find it!&rdquo; she was saying over and
over again under her breath.</p>
<p>Katherine was just as diligent in her search. She
pawed through the bushes with her white gloves and
sank on her knees in the soft grass, accumulating
more and more grass stains all the while. The last
streak of daylight faded and the big arc lights began
to blaze among the tall trees, and still they
searched&mdash;Katherine in a patient, systematic way,
Veronica hysterically. The few people who crossed
the square were closely questioned as to whether or
not they had found anything, but the same disappointing
answer came from all of them. Veronica
looked at her watch with ever-increasing anxiety;
Katherine looked at her furtively almost as often.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>After two hours of nerve-wracking search a
steeple clock nearby boomed out nine strokes;
slowly, deliberately, its clamor shattered the summer
night&rsquo;s stillness. Veronica sank down on a
stone which bordered the walk and covered her face
with her hands. Katherine straightened up and
stood for a moment looking thoughtfully at Veronica;
then she went on searching methodically. Veronica
sat huddled on the stone for fully five
minutes; then, with an expression which was
strangely like relief, she rose up and followed Katherine&rsquo;s
example. Fifteen minutes more went by
with scarcely a word from either girl. Then the
steeple clock chimed the quarter hour. A moment
later came the sound of a train whistle, far off,
but borne clearly on the still air, followed by the
faint rumble of distant cars going over a culvert.</p>
<p>Katherine stood still until the sound had died
away, then she went up to Veronica, led her to an
iron bench nearby, and shoved her into it. Then
she opened her handbag and took out a small black
wallet fastened round with an elastic band, and laid
it on Veronica&rsquo;s knee without a word.</p>
<p>Veronica looked at it and uttered an incredulous
scream of joy. &ldquo;Where did you find it?&rdquo; she
gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back on Elm Street, before I met you,&rdquo; said
Katherine quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back on Elm Street, before you met me?&rdquo; repeated
Veronica wonderingly. &ldquo;You had it all this
while?&rdquo; Katherine nodded. &ldquo;Then why did you
keep it all this while?&rdquo; demanded Veronica. &ldquo;Why
didn&rsquo;t you give it to me at once and save all this
agony?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katherine looked at her narrowly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
dare give it to you <i>before nine o&rsquo;clock</i>,&rdquo; she said
significantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>Veronica started and clutched Katherine&rsquo;s arm
nervously. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked
faintly.</p>
<p>Katherine put her arm around Veronica and drew
her toward her so she could look into her face. The
light from the swinging arc was directly upon her.
&ldquo;You were going to run away on that nine o&rsquo;clock
train, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked quietly.</p>
<p>Veronica jerked away and turned dreadfully pale.
&ldquo;How&mdash;how did you know?&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, for sure,&rdquo; said Katherine. &ldquo;But I made
a pretty good guess. You see, when I found that
wallet, I naturally looked inside. There I saw your
name, five hundred dollars in bills, and a note which
read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Take the New York Central Flyer at nine
o&rsquo;clock Wednesday night.&rsquo; It was signed with the
initials A. T., which I suppose stand for that friend
of yours with the plush whiskers, Alex Toboggan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alex Tobin,&rdquo; corrected Veronica under her
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looked suspicious to me,&rdquo; continued Katherine.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him around with you a good deal,
and I don&rsquo;t like his looks, not a little bit. Then a
minute later I came upon you with a suitcase, hunting
your wallet and looking at your watch as if you
were crazy. So I came to the conclusion that you
were planning to run away on that nine o&rsquo;clock
train, and decided to hold you up by keeping the
money until the train was gone. Am I right?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>Veronica&rsquo;s eyes dropped and her face was crimson.
&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; she said unsteadily. &ldquo;I was
planning to run away on that train. After I dropped
out of the Camp Fire Group I had no girl friends
and became lonelier and lonelier all the while. The
only interest I had was my music, and the only
place to which I went was to hear the Symphony
Orchestra rehearse. There, Alex Tobin, who is
really a fine violinist, was always very friendly to
me and kept telling me I should go to New York
and study with Martini, who is the best teacher in
the country. Uncle would not let me go because he
said I was too young and he could not go with me.
But Alex Tobin kept telling me that uncle was jealous
of my talent and was trying to keep me back on
purpose, and if I had any money in my own right I
should take it and go anyhow. Uncle quarreled
with Alex Tobin and after that he forbade me to
have anything to do with him, but he used to meet
me outside, and always he talked about my talent,
and what a shame it was I could not study with
Martini, and things like that, until I began to think
I was abused. I was very lonely, you know, and
had nothing else to think about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this week was the end of the Symphony
Orchestra rehearsals, and Alex Tobin was going
home to New York. He promised me that if I
would play in a restaurant there in which he is interested
he would see me safely there and introduce
me to Martini. He talked so much about it that I
finally yielded and said I would go. I had money in
the bank, but could not draw it out without uncle&rsquo;s
consent. However, just this week he wanted to invest
five hundred dollars for me and gave me his
signature so I could get it. You know how easy
uncle is about money matters, and he thought it was
perfectly all right to send me to the bank alone. I
have gone about by myself so much, you know. But
instead of going to his studio with it, as I was supposed
to, I kept it with me and did not go home at
all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was to meet Mr. Tobin in the station at a quarter
before nine. If I was not there when the train
went he was going without me. I was so excited all
day I did not have time to stop and think what I
was doing, and how terrible it was to run away
from uncle and aunt, when they had been so kind
to me, even to study with Martini. I looked upon
Alex Tobin as my friend and benefactor, instead of
a horrid, scheming man, as I see he is now. He just
wanted me to play in that restaurant of his for nothing,
and draw crowds, and beyond that he really
didn&rsquo;t care what became of me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When I lost the money I was nearly frantic, because
I was afraid I would miss the train. But
when the clock struck nine and I knew the train
was gone, I suddenly felt glad, glad, although I
had been so anxious to go. For I had come to myself
and felt sick at the thought of what I had
almost done. Oh, Katherine, how can I ever thank
you for keeping me from doing it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try,&rdquo; said Katherine cheerfully, rubbing
away at a grass stain on her skirt with the wreck of
a white silk glove.</p>
<p>For the first time Veronica noticed Katherine&rsquo;s
white dress. &ldquo;Oh, Katherine,&rdquo; she exclaimed in
distress, &ldquo;tonight is your class banquet! I heard
some of the other girls talking about it. And you
have missed it for my sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, so it is,&rdquo; said Katherine, with a well-feigned
start of recollection. &ldquo;I had forgotten all
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you didn&rsquo;t forget it,&rdquo; persisted Veronica;
&ldquo;you deliberately spent the time here with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind about that,&rdquo; said Katherine
soothingly. &ldquo;It was worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worth it? Oh, Katherine, after the way I have
treated you! I once called you a peasant, but you
are noble&mdash;you are a princess! It is I who am not
fit to associate with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Glory!&rdquo; exclaimed Katherine in an embarrassed
way. Katherine was like a fish out of water
when anyone began to express emotion. &ldquo;Forget
about the whole business,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and come back
into the group. You need to have something on your
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They will never take me back now,&rdquo; said Veronica
sadly, &ldquo;after this dreadful thing I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; maintained Katherine,
&ldquo;you came to your senses in time. We all have
done some pretty foolish things, I guess, if they
weren&rsquo;t quite so startling as the one you planned.
But anyway, they&rsquo;ll never know a thing about it, so
they can&rsquo;t have the laugh on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;ll never tell anyone?&rdquo; cried Veronica
unbelievingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a soul,&rdquo; said Katherine earnestly. &ldquo;Not any
of the Winnebagos, nor your uncle, nor your aunt,
nor even Nyoda. Never a word, on my honor as a&mdash;a
peasant! If I had intended telling anyone I&rsquo;d
have taken your wallet to your uncle right away,
with the note in it, instead of keeping you back in
the way I did. But I knew you&rsquo;d come to yourself
presently, and there was no use making a fuss. I&rsquo;ll
keep your secret, never fear. I won&rsquo;t even have to
explain my absence from the class banquet. They
all know how absent-minded I am, and they will
simply think I forgot. That&rsquo;s the advantage of
having a reputation!&rdquo; And Veronica, looking into
Katherine&rsquo;s homely, honest face, knew that her
word would stand against flood and earthquake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think the Winnebagos will take
me back?&rdquo; she asked timidly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>For answer Katherine picked up Veronica&rsquo;s suitcase,
linked her arm through hers, and started homeward
at a lively pace. &ldquo;You <i>are</i> back,&rdquo; she said
simply. &ldquo;You never were really &lsquo;put out,&rsquo; you
know. You left of your own accord and we have
missed you very much and were just waiting for
you to say the word. Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; And her
feet began to shuffle back and forth in a lively manner,
and she began to hum in sprightly tones the
tune, &ldquo;When Johnny Comes Marching Home.&rdquo;
Thus it was that the Torch, carried by Katherine,
drew Veronica to the Fire after all, although Katherine
did not even know that she held the Torch in
her hand.</p>
<p class="tb">The last meeting of the Winnebagos with Nyoda
came, oh, much too soon! The boys were warned
to stay away, for not even these dear friends were
to be allowed to disturb the sacredness of that gathering.
They cooked supper for the last time, trying
to be riotously cheerful, with the tears dripping off
the ends of their noses into the dishes. All the
favorite Winnebago messes were cooked, because
Nyoda couldn&rsquo;t decide which one she wanted most.
There was Shrimp Wiggle and Slumgullion and
scones and ice cream with Wohelo Special Sauce,
which was a heavenly mixture of maple syrup, chocolate
and chopped nuts.</p>
<p>The feast was soon spread, and they gathered
around the table to sing the Camp Fire blessing,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;If we have earned the right to eat this bread,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>and most of the voices quavered before they came
to the end.</p>
<p>That supper remained in their memories many
years afterward. Katherine had to deliver all her
familiar speeches over and over again; Migwan,
who had come home from college in time to attend
the farewell meeting, gave a fine history of the
group from its beginning; Gladys danced her best
dances; and all the favorite stunts were gone
through and the favorite songs sung. And Nyoda
looked upon and listened to it all with a smiling face
and tear-dimmed eyes. The Winnebagos had
formed a large part of her life for the past three
years. Veronica, who was at the supper, and had
been welcomed back into the group with open arms
upon her humble apology, wept disconsolately most
of the time. To have been restored to the good
graces of this wonderful young woman, only to
lose her again immediately afterward! She bitterly
regretted her withdrawing from the group during
the winter and thus losing her last opportunity of
comradeship with Nyoda.</p>
<p>Supper over they wandered out into the warm
June twilight to watch for the evening stars before
beginning the ceremonial meeting. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have the
same stars as you do, anyhow,&rdquo; said Hinpoha, &ldquo;and
when they come out we&rsquo;ll think of each other, will
you, Nyoda?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I will,&rdquo; said Nyoda, heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when Cassiopea comes out the W will stand
for Winnebago,&rdquo; added Gladys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that long scraggly constellation will remind
you of me,&rdquo; said Katherine, and they all had to
laugh in spite of their sadness.</p>
<p>By and by they wandered back to the House of
the Open Door and Nyoda went up alone and left
them standing before the door. Then pretty soon
the signal bird calls floated up and Nyoda&rsquo;s voice
called down from above, saying, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;
and they answered with the foolish passwords and
countersigns that they loved because they were so
foolish. One by one they climbed the ladder and
took their places in the circle, their eyes on Nyoda,
as she twirled the drill with the bow, kindling their
last Council Fire. The spark came immediately and
leapt into flame and kindled the fagots piled on the
hearth. Feeling the spell of it as they never had before,
they sang &ldquo;Burn, Fire, Burn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came the last roll call. Nyoda&rsquo;s voice lingered
lovingly on each name: &ldquo;Hinpoha; Sahwah;
Geyahi (Gladys); Iagoonah; Medmangi; Nakwisi;
Waban (Veronica).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Migwan read the Count, written in her inimitable
lilting metre, which touched on the many happy
times they had had together, and ended,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;All too brief that Moon of Gladness,</p>
<p class="t0">Long shall be the years of parting!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then Hinpoha put her head on her knee with a
stifled sob, and at that they all broke down and cried
together, with their arms around Nyoda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come girls, be good,&rdquo; said Nyoda, after a minute,
sitting up and wiping her eyes. &ldquo;Stand up and
take your honors like men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she proceeded to raise all the girls who had
not already taken that honor, to the rank of Torchbearer,
excepting, of course, Veronica. As she
awarded the pins she spoke a few words to each
girl, telling in what way she had become worthy of
this highest rank. When she came to Katherine,
she laid her hand on her shoulder. &ldquo;Good wine
needs no bush,&rdquo; she said with a whimsical smile.
&ldquo;And Katherine needs no advocate. Her actions
speak for themselves. Her masterly handling of
that volley ball game the other day gives the keynote
to her character. The ability to snatch victory
from seeming defeat is a gift which will carry one
far in the world. And do not forget that Katherine
went into that game as a humble filler-in, simply to
oblige the team, and without a thought of gaining
any glory thereby. That is what I meant by losing
one&rsquo;s self in the common cause which is a necessary
qualification for a Torchbearer. Katherine would
go to any trouble to help somebody else get glory
for themselves, or to help them out of trouble.&rdquo;
And Veronica almost burst with the desire to tell
of the last great service Katherine had done her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>Katherine blushed at Nyoda&rsquo;s words and winked
back the tears and dropped the pin, and murmured
brokenly that she would try to be a worthy Torchbearer,
and would do her best to stop being so absent-minded.
And then all the Torchbearers, new
and old, joined hands in a circle and repeated their
desire:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The light that has been given to me</p>
<p class="t0">I desire to pass undimmed unto others.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now a word about the future,&rdquo; said Nyoda,
putting wood on the fire and sending the flames
roaring up the chimney. &ldquo;You girls declare you do
not want another Guardian. I heartily agree with
you in this. That does not mean that I would be
jealous of a possible successor. But I think the
time has come when you no longer need a Guardian.
For three years you have been bound together by ties
stronger than sisterhood, and have had all the fun
that it is possible for girls to have, working always
as a unit. You have stood in a close circle, always
facing inward. Now you must turn around and
face outward. You have been leaders from the beginning,
and I have trained you as leaders. And a
leader must stand alone. Each one of you will
have a different way of passing on the light. The
time has come to begin. The old order has passed
when you did every thing under my direction. You
must kindle new Camp Fires now and teach to
others the things you have learned.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nyoda,&rdquo; cried Gladys sorrowfully, &ldquo;do you
mean that all our good times together are over?
That this is the end of it all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear, this is not the end,&rdquo; said Nyoda cheerfully,
&ldquo;this is the &lsquo;beginning of it all.&rsquo; I do not
mean for a moment that you girls are not to meet
and frolic together any more; but that must not be
the main thing. You must begin leading groups of
younger girls and teaching them to have a good
time as you have learned to. What wonderful
Guardians you will make in time!&rdquo; she said musingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she added, after a moment&rsquo;s silence,
while the girls thoughtfully pondered the new idea
she had given them, &ldquo;you had come to the parting
of the ways, although you didn&rsquo;t seem to realize it.
You have graduated from school, and next year
Hinpoha and Gladys and Katherine are going away
to college, each one to a different city, and Nakwisi
is to travel with her aunt, and Veronica will be going
to New York to study music sooner or later. That
leaves only Sahwah and Medmangi here in the city.
You couldn&rsquo;t go on as you have in the past, even if
I were not going away. But come,&rdquo; she cried in an
animated tone, &ldquo;enough of solemn talk! We&rsquo;ve had
three years together, and nobody can take them
away from us, never. And we&rsquo;re all together now.
Let the future take care of itself; this is today!
Come, come, a song!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>And once more the rafters rang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O we are Winnebagos and we&rsquo;re loyal friends and true,</p>
<p class="t0">We always work in harmony in everything we do,</p>
<p class="t0">We always think the weather&rsquo;s fine, in sunshine or in snow,</p>
<p class="t0">We&rsquo;re happy all the time because we&rsquo;re maids of Wohelo!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The echoes died away and then sprang into life
again.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;For we are Winnebagos,</p>
<p class="t0">For we are Winnebagos,</p>
<p class="t0">For we are Winnebagos,</p>
<p class="t0">And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re so spry!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A toast!&rdquo; cried Nyoda, &ldquo;a toast to the future!&rdquo;
And they drank it in the remains of the cocoa.
Their eyes met as they clinked the cups, and overflowed.
&ldquo;Oh, my girls,&rdquo; cried Nyoda, trying to get
her arms around all of them at once, &ldquo;there never
<i>was</i> such a group! And there never <i>will</i> be such a
group! I just can&rsquo;t leave you!&rdquo; Then she pulled
herself up again. The time was passing and she
must hasten, for she was leaving on the train late
that night. Her marriage was to take place in the
East. &ldquo;Come, girls, &lsquo;Mystic Fire.&rsquo;&rdquo; And once
again their voices rose in musical chant:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;With hand uplifted we claim thy power,</p>
<p class="t0">Guide and keep us as we go,</p>
<p class="t0">True to Wohelo.</p>
<p class="t0">Thy law is our law from this hour,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy mystic spirit&rsquo;s flame will show</p>
<p class="t0">Us the way to go.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>And so on to the end.</p>
<p>But when they stood in the close circle with which
the song ends, Nyoda stooped to the hearth, and,
plucking forth a burning brand, held it aloft as a
torch, and the girls passed in front of her, each
carrying a tiny torch in her hand, which she lit
from the big one. Then the circle stood complete
once more, a ring of shining light. Silence fell on
all. The moment of parting had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say good-bye,&rdquo; begged Nyoda. &ldquo;Act as if
I were a guest just leaving for a short time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And bravely, with voices that did not falter to
the end, they sang the familiar guest song:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Our guest, may she come again soon&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>and followed it with a fervent cheer:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O Nyoda, here&rsquo;s to you,</p>
<p class="t0">Our hearts will e&rsquo;er be true,</p>
<p class="t0">We will never find your equal</p>
<p class="t0">Though we search the whole world through!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then the circle turned resolutely and faced outward.
A moment more they lingered, and then they
went forth into the night, carrying their torches
with them.</p>
<p class="tbcenter"><span class="small">THE END</span></p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
